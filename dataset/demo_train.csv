negative,Give it a few months.,"Straight and simple: Wait for a couple more patches. It has the potential to be a great game, but the game is presently just loaded with bugs that Activision was just too lazy to fix in the Beta versions.Buy it, but not yet."
positive,Works as advertised,"However getting it back into the case following use is difficult because of the small case size. I use it when on the ""trail"" but would advise something more durable for use at home."
positive,very good product,I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. I have frizzy hair and when I wash my hair with it the hair feels very smooth and soft. I love the fact that cleanser and conditioner are all in one. Saves time. Great product.
positive,A Great Way to Learn and Practice Ericksonian Hypnosis Language .,"The authentic Zebu Cards as Robert Anue first published them. As a NLP Practitioner and Trainer, I use these cards in my seminars to support and expand on the Milton Model language skills. A great fun and portable game that will get you thinking, speaking and influencing in a whole different way."
negative,"They call him boss....BOSS ""N"" WORD!!!","This is a movie that I KNEW was gonna be a hoot!BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!It was too serious to be funny ant too funny to be serious. The acting from Boss was great but there was too much silly stuff and the sund quality was not great, even for an older movie.I think a remake would be good. Make it serious with just a few jokes in it."
negative,A poor and cynical effort,"Though it has a few decent points, this book feels like a vanity press publication that, in the main, is little more than the author ranting about how Hollywood doesn't appreciate his immense genius, even though that genius has produced nothing other than Stigmata (a film, I should add, whose deep, dark secret - the Gospel of Thomas - is so secret that it has been available as a paperback for many, many years). At one point he claims that most books about screenwriting are merely cynical attempts for failing screenwriters to make a fast buck. He adds that this book is not one of them. He is wrong, it is."
positive,Matt's Mario Hoops Review,I am 7 years old and I love this video game. It is challenging in all sorts of ways. I like to do special shots as Yoshi. I would recommend this video game to any kids who like basketball and Mario games. There are different kinds of courts when you get better at the game. There are different players when you get to a different tournaments. Enjoy the game!
positive,*THIS IS A MUST READ!*,"This book is a well-written one about a 13 yr. old grl called Dawn. She expresses what she does with her friends and family. She meets new friends like the postitive grl, Amalia. This book tells us about what Dawn's point of view of everything. This is a good chanz to find out what Dawn is thinking about her family and friends. This book is actually funny and interesting to read! If I were u, I would get this one and read it!"
negative,Leaks like crazy,If you don't have this sitting exactly at the right angle it leaks! It doesn't matter if it's full to the top or 1/2 empty... it constantly drips!!!!
positive,good,"Arrived earlier than expected. Ordered this as a back-up for when my Andis clippers heat up and I'm able to change the other blade with this one. CeramicEdge is supposed to be better, but I don't really know the difference."
positive,ONE OF THE BEST CDs I HAVE HEARD,While I have never been a great fan of Baby Face when I heard this particular CD I had to have it. I shall be looking for other CDs by this artist. The CD is one of my favorites.
positive,Amazing Value for Mike Myers Greatest trilogy,Hilarious comedy brought to you by one of Canada's funniest comedians: Mike Myers!
negative,Terrible.,"This movie was...terrible.I can usually tolerate some pretty stupid stuff, but Jenny and Carmen's acting in this movie was atrocious. And it wasn't funny. At least Eddie is a sweetheart."
negative,Please don't waste your money,"I went through one of Bob's programs. I devoted 2 1/2 years of my life there. I was an alcoholic in desperate need of help. Walking into the group seemed like the answer but I've spent the last few years recovering from the Meehan experience. Bob is a sick man, with sick motives. He is not qualified to tell anyone how to get children sober. He is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. He will drain your pocketbooks and dismantle your family with his ""tools of recovery"". He is a cult leader. If you or someone you love is in the program, get out!!!"
positive,AWESOME!!!!,WOW I am a die hard nip tuck fan and i have every season on DVD and this was just the best addition to my collection... there were some pretty interesting episodes but holy cow this show gets more twisted with every episode! I cant wait for season 5 to begin!!! California all the way baby!
negative,It's Defective,"My Son bought me this Seal-A-Meal for Christmas last year. With the price of meat going up, I decided to give it a try this week. Worked fine the first few times, then died an untimely death leaving me with 5 pounds of hamburger in 1 pound packs needing to be sealed. Let it sit thinking it maybe needed a break, but no, it just doesn't work any more. I loved it while it worked, it was great. Don't love it now, and wouldn't buy another as it's not dependable. Contacted Rival Customer Service, but they only quoted the trouble shooting page of the appliance hand book, so no help from them. Wish I could report differently, but I've not had a good experience with this product."
negative,Video,"Well, lets see... I have not seen this before but I know how this movie goes. This big flower can't do anything himself so... he hypnotizes people to do dirty work. I heard rumors that Rini isn't in this episode so... that's why the stars are so... low. I don't know what the Geneon Signature Series are."
negative,WORST ELECTRIC RAZOR I'VE EVER OWNED,"I had this razor for a year and just threw it away. From the start, the beard trimmer would pop-up unexpectantly. After six months, the trimmer wouldn't lock back in at all. If the battery were dead, I couldn't just plug the razor in the wall and use it; I would have to wait several hours for it to charge up. It had difficulty cutting just two days of stubble. The foils are not particularly durable. The rear foil in particular would develope a massive hole every 2-3 months. This is the first electric razor I've owned that was truly a piece of junk."
positive,I Did Not Want to Like This Show,"After The Practice went out and became so tired and this show was pegged to be a spinoff I had no intention of even watching, let alone liking it. It seemed like a showcase for actors past their prime. Put simply, I was wrong. It is a smartly written show and James Spader and William Shatner could not be better. That goes for the supporting cast, too. It is one of the few shows I look forward to each week. I dont know that it has the drama that the Practice had but its certainly more entertaining overall and easily one of the best shows on tv. It deserves any Emmy it gets."
positive,Absolutely fantastic!,"This album is like a dream come true. The combination of Ella Fitzgerald's voice, clear, true and haunting with Cole Porter's complex, enchanting lyrics is truly incomparable. It has become one of my favorites."
negative,Extremely dissatisfied,"The product was not received. I am still waiting to hear from the shipper. No contact number, no tracking number, nothing. This purchase has cost me much inconvenience and grief. I need some kind of compensation for this."
negative,Apple Slicer,Didn't work on solid apples like granney smith. Apples must also be symetrical and not too firmLeifheit Pro Line Stainless Steel Apple Slicer/Corer
negative,No way I am getting fooled again,The title speaks for itself. I gonna keep watching my DVDs til the extended blu-rays come out
positive,A Brief and Interesting Primer,"The title of Stephen Haycox' book is slightly misleading, as the first half of the work details imperial Russia's ""discovery,"" exploration and exploitation of Alaska before selling the massive territory to America in 1867 for $7.2 million (about two cents an acre). The book is a brief and interesting primer on Alaskan history from the middle of the 18th century to the dawn of the 21st. Haycox concentrates on sociocultural conflicts between natives and incomers; interminable discord between environmentalists and industrialists; and since statehood in 1959, strife between competing native, state, and federal sovereignty claims over land and resources. Particularly in the first half of the book, Haycox occasionally obsesses with minutia better left to a lengthier examination. Nonetheless, this is a good and well-written introduction to Alaskan history, including an ample bibliography for readers interested in learning more about America's ""Last Frontier."""
negative,A failure to cash in,"After remarkable performances by some real actors and a compelling story line in the original ""Firestarter,"" this effort to use it as a kickoff for a sequel flops. Hollywood never learns."
negative,Long and Boring,"Margaret George has painted flat and unrealistic characters with no flaws. She would have us believe Cleopatra and Caesar were wise and benevolent rulers without any emotions. Nineteen year old Cleopatra, too often, speaks in the voice of a 21st century, thirty year old woman. It seems George knows her history however, she papers over her characters' documented bad behavior with made-up excuses and sometimes she ignores historical facts altogether.This book is for people looking for lush and extravagant romance novels with gilded ships, jewel encrusted furniture and silk robes. For those who like good historical fiction, look elsewhere."
negative,Beware,"Don't choose T-Mobile. I live in Sacramento Ca. I had no coverage in my home. I could never even finish the Blackberry set-up. I also traveled in Minnesota, When I got off the plane at Minneapolis International airport (a major airline hub)I had no coverage there either. I had to use a land line! I used a total of 16 mins. I cancelled within the trial period and was still charged $51.00. Save your money and go with one of the major carriers. I will wait for the i phone."
positive,Not Bad At All,I think this games is really good the only thing I think would be cool would be to add street cars like old school muscle cars other than thats its the best drag racing game I've ever played tunning can be tough but once you find the right set ups its awesome I would defiently recommend it plus its only $15
negative,Their worst,"The Scorpions are my favorite band but I even thought this CD s*cked. It seems like the scorpions might have permanantly lost their sting since Crazy World, cuz Face the heat s*cked too.Its sad to see a great (and my favorite) band sink themselves to this level.If you have never heard the Scorpions, hearing this will make you never want to hear their best work"
positive,"sensitive, accurate movement.","I love mine. It's very accurate for movement and works well on different surfaces.Better even than the Microsoft wheel mouse, personally.these are the downsides: if you bounce it , the switches trigger and the whole thing should be larger. I will definitely buy another one of these."
negative,Fizzer,"Why did I buy it? Looked good, sounded good. Lived up to it's promise? Too many group shots of chatty singles in salubrious discussion. Would have been nice to have seen more shots of the food. In the end, the recipies themselves proved to be a little more of the same. Unimaginative, hardly unique."
negative,You call this a movie????,"The first Batman movie has got to be one of the most cheesiest heroic movies of all times. I've watched this film over and over and over again, and it still doesn't get to me. It's full of too much romance and way too much violence. I wasn't too thrilled with the pick of characters for this film. Jack Nicholson did an okay job as ""The Joker"", but again here's another movie where Michael Keaton is playing himself. He never takes his Batman job seriously. And I can't stand Kim Basinger in this film! Her wardrobe is God-awful!! When you're on a date, at least comb your hair and put on a decent dress than something handed from a second-hand store. And I can't stand her screaming in about every other horror scene. This Batman movie was a joke to begin with. The other two Batman movies were okay, despite the last one was without Michael Keaton.I was hoping for an action-packed movie when it first came out, unfortunately, I was very disappointed."
positive,The Porcupine edition is NOT ABRIDGED!,"The other review on this page is incorrect! It's a cut-and-paste job from a review of the Great Minds edition, which is abridged. The porcupine edition is NOT ABRIDGED. If you are reading Marshall's principles for the first time, or if you want a copy for reference, this is the edition you want to buy. I don't know who is responsible for the cutting-and-pasting, but this error should be corrected right away."
positive,Good book,"I like the new heroine and hope to see more of her. Although I have faithfully read all the Plum books, I was getting rather jaded with a hamster that never dies and cars that blow up on a regular basis. Alex is a pleasant departure and Ms. Evanovich has kept the sense of humor going. The new characters surrounding Alex are a hoot and I hope that if Alex returns, they do also. A pleasant mixture of wackiness and fun."
positive,Surprise,This album was quite surprise for me. I thought Seru Giran was the only good rock band on Argentina scene. This blokes are good musicians with good vocals and nice songs. Keep going.
positive,Weber Gold,"Have always been a Weber fan, but, due to financial circumstances, had to opt for the charcoal portable run about, offbrand seen in the big box stores. In the interum, also opted for a propane models from various manufacturers. Not a fan of propane. Give me charcoal.Went back to Weber gold this year for summer barbque season and am so relieved to be again using a Weber.A couple things that other reviewers have also noted:Lid handle needs to move back to the old wood type or a type that does not heat up. Would like to order if Weber makes one available.The lid tends to move off the bowl when moving to another location for BBQ'ing. Larger lip would eliminate this issue. Did'nt have this with my older models, pre 1990. Don't know when this change was made."
negative,Not the soundtrack,"I ordered this and sent it back. If you're looking for a soundtrack of ""Belizaire the Cajun,"" in particular the opening and closing song, this doesn't have it. Sure, it has the song but not the performance and not the version you heard and enjoyed in the film. The film version was passionate and rhythmically complex, syncopated. The CD version is shorter, quieter, rhythmically feeble and about as passionate as a lullaby for patients in a dyspeptic ward. I got my money back for misrepresentation."
positive,Great Fence,"Easy to set up. I have the Jessem table and the holes are pre set. However, I think it would not take that much more with another brand table. The fence is really solid and heavy. Fit and finish are out- standing. Vacuum port works fine. Zeros out perfectly. Easy to calibrate. A high end tool.Is it better than a lower priced fence? Fence setting is way above other fences. But I have made some beautiful stuff with my old Rockler fence and table. Those are moderately priced and quite good. You are paying for quality when you step up another hundred bucks. If I was just starting out with router tables and fences, I'd like to think I would pass by the Rockler and move straight to the Jessem. For the long haul, that's the best choice. But maybe money considerations would pull me to the Rockler. Both are good products, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.Will"
negative,The first book I've thrown in the trash in years,"What a waste of time. I so long for the days of 'real men' conservatives like William F. Buckley, who I may not have always agreed with, but admired for his intellectual grasp of situations. Where is a decent voice from the right? Someone who can actually think? Alas, will we be stuck with [guys] like this forever?"
positive,Helps me keep my game sharp,"I much prefer to play with friends, but the Pro Bridge 610 is a pretty good way to play and getter better atthe game. The button layout takes some getting used to, but the screen is big, and has lighting."
positive,very good short no nonsense book,Compact size. Carefully put together information. Solid basics given without too many words but understandable. Pictures are very helpfull and exceptional quality. This is cheap and good book for novice GS owner. I favor this book out of 4 i bought before.
negative,"MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE",Can't buy something when I have no idea what footage this includes. Please add a description and I will consider buying this and other National Archives DVD's.
negative,Terrible product,"This is a terrible radio. I wanted it for work just to listen to some sports talk radio or music in the morning. Unfortunately, it basically does not pick up any AM stations. And the FM stations don't come in much better. The tuner is terrible too, as it is so sensitive you have trouble getting it to the station you want (if that station will even come in on it). All in all, i'm just warning you not to buy this radio."
positive,Filter,"The product works great for Small aquariums. I used mine for my bettas, and my dwarf puffer fish. The current is strong, but it can be maneuvered to be less likely to blow your fish around. I rate this product 4 stars, because the filter can intake a lot of water and air, and leaves the aquarium with a bubbly curtain on the glass,although it works great. It could use some better filter cartridges. this one is a simple sponge. Overall, I would reccommend this for someone using it on a 5 gallon tank or less."
negative,Tan solo MARAVILLOSO !!!!,"Sr.Benitez sus Libros me han abierto a un mundo nuevo, donde me hace sentir sentimientos encontrados que es la religión clasica que existe de hace varios años y lo nuevo que de repente hace dudar si es verdad o manetira. Tan solo el tiempo o la circunstancias de la vida nos iran desengañando o suminirnos en nuestra propia decepción. Gracias y espero algún día conocerlo aunque sea por la via del E-mail. Saludos, Joe W. Retamal A."
negative,Don't buy this cartridge!,"And here are two good reasons why I titled this review the way I did:1. The cartridge leaked in the bag.2. The cartridge didn't even fit my Epson Photo EX (though the compatibility number is correct).While their b&w cartridge works fine, I'd go with Epson original color cartridge."
positive,A great complement to Janet Esposito's book,"This is a great CD on its own or as a complement to Janet's book. My favorite thing about the CD is that you can listen to selected pieces of it for a quick reinforcer if you are short on time, or you can listen to the entire CD when you have the luxury of time to treat yourself to a relaxing and centering experience. The CD is great for my head, my heart, my spirit, and my body. I will use it often and recommend it highly to others."
negative,did not work,This would not install on my new computer with windows xp. I tried and tried finally gave up and purchased Nero and it works great so no more Roxy Products for me.
negative,roller skating rink organ !,"Slim was one of the best blues pianists ever. And this album has some fine piano blues on it too.But almost every other song has Slim playing a roller skating rink sounding organ which grates on my nerves. If you like blues organ, then fine, but if you're looking for some of Slim's classic piano blues ,this might not be the album for you to purchase."
positive,Lots to think about,"The coolest thing about this devotional book is that each month is themed on a different aspect of God. For example, January is God's Character; June is Persecution and December is Christmas Around the World. The reason I like this is because some devotional books feel like they skip around and are hit-and-miss on topics. I love that this one devotes more than three or four pages to a topic.Even the introduction, by Beth Moore, is impressive and really makes you think about missions. She also wrote an intro into each month. The devotions themselves are written by those who are out doing the work of God. It's interesting to see what they write and to try to read it in the context of what they deal with on a daily basis.I think this would be a good gift for a missions teacher, a student studying to be a missionary or even a church mission leader.I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review from Book Sneeze."
negative,USB vaccum Cleaner/Hoover for Laptop PC Keyboard-Black,"This item don't met my expectations,because don't clean well, not a new package is used before, I don't recommend this item."
negative,Wheel Of Time,"Jordan had the start of what could have been an amazing series... unfortunately, he refuses to end it, and is really just milking the cash cow now, on his 9th book. Ironically, the Wheel Of Time Series is much like the Wheel Of Time In The Book, repetitive and never-ending."
positive,Perfect,"Perfect product. I have 5 of them with out a single complaint. If I had to complain I would say the plastic anchors are a little sub par, but I used my own anyway. I also installed small rubber door stops behind each guitar because they are hanging in a hall way where they could get bumped into the wall. Under normal circumstances the guitar hangs plenty far enough from the wall (even a full size acoustic). Click on my name above for a picture of guitars hanging, shouldn't the manufacturer show you that?"
positive,5 Stars 4 Sure,"Not Big enough for Table Saws as pictured but it covers every thing else..... Jig saws Belt sander's my 18 1/2 Planer etc. Magnet's keep cover in place while I blow down my shop and cover keeps most dust, dirt and dampness of my machine tops......... worth EVERY Penny! Buy several!"
negative,If you like arm-wrestling . . .,"Makes a nice smooth shot of espresso - but at the price of a sweaty arm-wrestling match combined with a chemistry lab experiment. You have to buy a digital thermometer, get the water temperature just right (not an easy feat, regardless of how you go about it), and then wrestle the plunger down, which takes closer to two minutes than the 20 seconds in the instruction guide, the darn rubber gasket is so tight. Which means the espresso is more bitter than it should be, due to the water sitting in it so long while you wreck your arm trying to get the plunger to go down without knocking the coffee cup over. I'm honestly surprised by all the good reviews here - it might be cheap, and if you can get it work right the coffee is good, but this is not an easy unit to use."
positive,One of the better self-defense systems.,"I am former military and I have a martial arts background. True, Krav Maga is a basic self-defense system but if you want to learn to defend yourself without spending years at it, this is one of my favorite systems. No forms, no belts and no kung fu silliness that could get you killed on the street.The videos show the techniques in slow motion and at street speed and they also have a solo training exercise at the end of each technique.This won't turn you into Bruce Lee but it is worth the money."
negative,Not a good buy!,"I purchased these in a size 5 for my daughter because a) they were less than some of the other stride rite shoes and b) they were adorable. Well, these were just unwearable and I even had them fitted and checked in the stride rite store. The velcro was always coming undone, the shoes always falling off plus they were very stiff so she had difficulty walking in them. In the end, we always had to take the shoes off for her to run around in until I finally conceded and bought a pair of the $42 katy (I belive) shoes which are what you would expect from a stride rite shoe."
negative,Didn't work well for me,"I followed directions, inserting the green bead with threads to the sides and it didn't work well. I'll be looking at another brand."
negative,Garbage,"I would have felt better if $20 would have blown away in the wind. At least someone would find it and it would have made their day.The fit? Horrible. They come with 4 differant sized plugs. The material reforms to shape too fast and does not allow for time to properly position. Once in, they want to work their way out.The sound. Like listening to music underwater. Mucky bass and no highs.I am very dissapointed with them and have thrown them away so I do not have to look at them to be reminded how I wasted good money. Time for me to step up and buy some decent phones. You get what you pay for."
positive,Awesome,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It reads very easily, and keeps the readers' interest. It really opens the reader's mind to what parents are capable of doing to their children. Walls has done well for herself, despite the extreme adversity she faced in this memoir."
positive,Not bad for the size and price,"Overall I am happy with these binoculars for the price and I am glad I paid a little extra to get the 10x over the 8x. They are a good set of binoculars if you want something small, compact and light. If you don't mind something a little heavier and bulkier (and paying a little more) I would get something even more powerful in hindsight. So far I have used them for bird watching out the back window and also at an airshow. They were great for the airshow because they were easy to carry on my belt without being a nuisance. I definitely enjoyed my time at the airshow and better knew what was happening on the ground because of them."
positive,A Daisy through Concrete,"On their 3rd album the Eels (pretty much a solo project for you know who), walk a fine balance between pop song perfection and sonic psunspots (that's an obscure reference to an album by another great rock band that makes very similiar music). The sharp songwriting on the title track and Grace Kelly Blues alternate with the loopy sounds from tunes like Flyswatter.A terrific album well worth owning and for anyone who gives a damn about great songwriting."
negative,Dumbed-down math as therapy for the masses,"This book contains some good writing and poor mathematics, quite aside from one's political point of view. The critical reviewers of the book are substantively correct. In terms of Ms. Cole's purpose and intended audience, well, what sort of ""success"" is dumbed-down math as therapy for the masses?"
positive,Excellent product I love it,it is really good for setting up target. there is one thing that this one gives different readings everytime.
positive,WOW!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is, well, WOW!! Enya rules and so does this CD. Her song Lothlorien is insrumental, and anyone who knows anything about Lord of the Rings'll know wehere that is inspired by! Her 6-minute song Smaonte is nice, too. No more words from me!"
negative,"Has a GIANT cord with GIANT hockey puck at the end. Not a ""unifying"" compatible mouse.","This ""cordless"" mouse has a gigantic cord, one end of which plugs into your USB port, the other end of which is attached to a hockey puck sized receiver. Other Logitech products use what they call a ""unifying"" receiver, which is this tiny little nub that plugs into your USB port and through which you can connect up to 5 different Logitech devices. This ""cordless"" mouse is NOT compatible with the unifying receiver, so if you have another ""unifying"" compatible product you will still need an extra USB port for this mouse. Want to use a trackball style mouse with a unifying receiver? They are rumored to exist, but I can't find hide nor hair of them on Logitech's website. There is NO trackball style mouse with a non-thumb controlled ball that is compatible with the unifying receiver. You are stuck with the giant cord and hockey puck for your ""cordless"" mouse."
positive,This is a must have.,I actually sat down and had a marathon watchibg this series as I wanted to get to the third season..What a fabulous fabulous show....so addictive you cannot wait to see what happens next.
negative,A waste of time and money,This book has no place in a serious students library or anywhere else. It is poorly laid out with no logical sequence or progression from one idea to the next. There is never any detailed explanation just a bunch of disjoint sentences that read like a Dr Seuss or some comic book. When I am stuck I never seem to get answers here. If you want to learn scheme I suggest skipping this one.
positive,Wish everyone would watch this video!,"This is a great DVD for the novice poker player! The DVD is professionally recorded and provides clear instruction on no limit hold 'em, and a few tricks of the game. Also provided is a chart with strategy, odds and positional advice. This DVD definitely helped my game and my wallet. I'd recommend it to anyone who is learning the game and wants to learn a good, conservative strategy."
negative,I think Miller farted this one out,"This is a disappointment. If you read the original , don't bother comparing it. Not that you should expect the same old thing since the original was a classic that cannot be repeated. This sequel seemed like a mere pretense of being a Dark Knight sequel. While reading it I got the feeling that Miller was just fooling arond and making up the story as he went along. Majority of the pages are filled of talking heads giving useless commentary about the world instead of dealing with the story. Borrow it from a friend or your library."
negative,Not much help,"Don't waste your money on this one. It was recommended by ""Rich Dad"" advisors, but doesn't tell you how to get going. And unless you live in or want to travel to one of the 29 ""lien states"" there's nothing in for you. The other states are not mentioned."
positive,Return of a Classic,Elements is one of the best introductions to statistical inference and econometrics ever published. I still refer to my copy 14 years after finishing my degree. Can't say that about any other textbook
negative,utter hypocrisy (as if we are surprised!),"The rabbi's pose is transparently hypocritical because Judaism's ""holiest"" book, the Talmud, teaches misogyny, the fundamental ""orthodox"" Judaic doctrine about women:""Though a woman be as a pitcher full of filth and her mouth be full of blood, yet all speed after her."" ---Talmud, Shabbat 152band also, ""...a man may do whatever he pleases with his wife at intercourse: Meat which comes from the abbatoir may be eaten salted, roasted, cooked or seethed; so with fish from the fishmonger.... A woman came before Rab and complained [of her husband's sodomy with her], ""Rabbi replied: 'Wherein does it differ from fish?"" ---Talmud, Nedarim 20b, Soncino edition, p.58"
positive,Wildly entertaining,"I bought this CD based on the reviews here, and I have not been disppointed. In fact, I'm in love with the songs! ""Tribute"" and ""Lee"" are awesome, and just TRY to get the gorgeously melodic ""Wonder Boy"" out of your head. I dare you! The rest of the album is simply silly, hard-rockin' fun. It will Rock Your Socks off! And the skits in between the songs will definitely make you laugh. ""Drive Thru"" is a crack up! Tenacious D is a delight!"
positive,BUY ME,"I think this is a must have for all drum 'n' bass lovers along with the album, 'Field of Action'. It starts off with a chilled beat before it kicks into something a little harder with a lot of pace. Suitable for playing in bedrooms!"
positive,Good in depth read on Rupert Murdoch,"Very interesting read. This biography goes into a lot of detail about Murdoch's first few decades in business - 50's to the end of the 80's.Very interesting insights into the man who created the most powerful media company in the world. This biography stands out compared to the others I have read, as the author has talked personally to a lot of people who dealt with Murdoch over the years.Jerome also has the benefit of writing this after having had a personal interview with Murdoch.The only downside is it was written at the end of the 80's, so it doesn't get to cover some of the most exciting times in the life of Murdoch.I'd thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Rupert Murdoch, or The News Corporation."
negative,unreadable,"I was looking forward to an imaginative and in-depth novel. Parts of this are almost intriguing, but they become lost in attempts at Biblical language. I quit before ending the novel because there was too much ""And now comes a donkey. And with the donkey comes so-and-so. And so-and-so might be the son of so-and-so else. And now into the room comes my father."" Not very exaggerated, either. This is how the language sounds, and how boring and irrelevant most of it is. She would have done better to just tell the tale in her own way and get on with it. I'm surprised this got published as is, but if you can weed through it for the ideas, you might find it worth your time? Notably intriguing was Mariamne cross-dressing to become John the Lesser, and Salome cross-dressing to become Simon Magus. Definite potential here."
positive,NY Fan...,"I was very excited when this cd came out.. I enjoy the range of different songs on there from the upbeat ""Hey Girl"" to the slow ""James"". I think this cd has been the best cd yet. I especially love the dvd.. Well mostly because I'm in it..Thanx guys for a great album."
positive,A little bent candy ain't nothing to cry over.,"First and foremost: My only gripe with this product is that no matter which seller you buy from, the storage they use leaves some of your airheads in a shape that is unrecognizable. Still candy, but still unrecognizable.However, I always get all 90 airheads and even numbers of all flavors, which I like. These are wonderful and, now that I think about it, can be used by a wise little entrepreneur if they so chose."
positive,Perfect Service,They give what they offer. I ordered a book and I got it the exact day they told me I would have it.
negative,"Violent, Racist, Boring","I know that is a weird combination, but the gore was over the top, Jews were depicted as depraved mobsters, and what plot that existed moved at a painfully slow pace. I was disappointed -- I'd heard this was a good ""sleeper"" movie. Suggest you skip this one!"
positive,Beautiful 5 Drawer Chest!,"I really like this 5-drawer chest, it looks beautiful once assembled and offers alot of storage. My only reason for not giving it a full five stars is it can be a bit difficult to assemble, the pieces can be a bit off (as in drill holes not quite in the right place, especially the drawers) but it all came together somehow and after many hours of assembly, I just love it. It is excellent for a small space, and even though I swore I would never put another one of these together, I like it so much I am considering adding more pieces at these great prices! Too bad Target doesn't offer a delivery and assembly service."
positive,It simply works well.,"If you are spending big bucks on your speakers you owe it to yourself to put these behind them.It made a very noticeable difference in the bass coming out of the 6"" woofers in my component system especially at higher volumes.I was turned into a believer."

negative,This toy is going on a one way trip back to the toy store!,"My 11 month old daughter received this from a family member for christmas. It was very time consuming to put together. Once assembeld my daughter tried to pull her self up and it tipped over. The ball would get stuck in the middle of the slide. Once pushed to the bottom they would only come out one hole. My daughter was very bored with this toy in seconds. If you want a toy that will keep your childs attention, pick up the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Learning Home. It is more expensive and larger (much easier to put together) But it is well worth the money."
negative,Neat and Tidy,"A very precice and neatly written book (not as good as her latest books) and too clean. Not enough rise to the climax, and it needs more twists. I would recommend this book only for preteens with a lot of free time."
negative,cult of brain wash,"Watch out! there is cult of people whose sole mission seems to be to try and trick you into thinking this is a movie that has any value. The latest Scwarzenneger film has more content. Furthermore, it's likely more intellectual. If you want to watch your neighbor's naughty kids home video, go ask. You don't need to buy this tape they're hocking."
negative,"It works, thats all I can say.","The little black plastic piece that cools the motor is very cheap. If anything bumps this piece it will break. I broke it off and luckily the HVAC Megastore shipped me a new one, and sent the old one back to the manufacturer to replace it. When then blower starts up its not a quiet as I would have hoped. I am no expert but it would have been nice to have a gasket with it, mine is installed metal to metal, but the seal is decent."
positive,Perfect casual mouse,"Being a touchpad user for so long I decided to give the mouse another try. Using so many different mice in labs around school I knew I wanted something with good tracking. The laser tracking lives up to it's name. I haven't found a surface it won't track on. On top of that, this mouse comes with a list of features. With the software you can program the buttons to perform a wide range of tasks. From internet browsing to window management. Pretty much every feature is customizable. I haven't found a better buy yet. This is a great product."
negative,Byzantium,"This book possibly expresses the author's thoughts, even understanding, with some accuracy. But to someone who is not already familiar with the point-of-view being expressed it is totally useless. It is easy enough to claim some sort of affiliation with Ramana Maharshi, but presenting the view of reality that Ramana enjoyed, described and promoted is a different matter altogether. This writer seems to relish riddle mongering. He assumes an air of authority, of greatly superior wisdom and insight, but anyone accustomed to reading the prose of genuine essayists, like George Orwell, for example, will find this writing similar to an act of sexual intercourse where one of the participants is entirely imaginary."
positive,Be Thankful,"In Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt touched me by his use of simple, straight forward use of vocabulary. In his writing, it was easy to tell that he wrote his true feelling while growing up, holding back nothing. When I read the book, it was like I was being told the story from a little, poor Irish boy, not an older man. McCourt's ability to do this created much more of an impact on the reader. It is amazing that he could remember such detail from his childhood. I started to feel like Frank McCourt, poor, hungry, and abused. At the same time I told myself never to complain about hunger or the need of clothes or shelter again. Not many books can do that for me, but this one did."
negative,major let down,i bought this game and i was so disappointed. It is good but i finished it in two hours. there is no save function and you cannot save during the middle of a game. there are 6 levels and you have to collect crystals and it is impossible. it has good graphics but it is very easy to finish
positive,Bought as a gift,I'd never heard of this book. It was purchased as a gift. The person I gave it to really enjoyed it.
negative,Please don't buy this book,"Certain aspects of life in 1277 England have to be taken into consideration. The nature of the genre of explicit romance is familiar enough, and one does expect more or less explicit sex scenes. Having said all that, Coulter did go to the extreme. I felt sickened after reading the book. As mentioned in the previous reviews, there are rape scenes, scenes of humiliation, a ""bad"" character (Marjorie) that gets one of the ""good"" guys and a castle, as well as the kid, for keeps. But the problem is not the rape scenes alone. Other books that contain rape scenes (for example Whitney My Love) treat the rape in a way that encourages the reader to put it in context - but not this book. By far one of the worst romance novels I have read. Finishing it, I was glad that I read other books by the same author (like The Wild Baron) that are far better."
positive,perfect fit seals very well.,"Got this in mid summer, and my 4.5 yrs daughter adjusted to it in the first try. it is well sealed from water, and does not leave face marks if you don't do it too tight. the side adjuster is comfortable to use for loosening it. the only thing is hair sometimes gets in it and you need to take it off gently. if you have a long haired child , you'll need to make a pony tail in a height that will fit in between the two straps, and that will prevent the straps from slipping down and back.these are very good swimming goggles"
negative,One Step to Boredom,"Yes I used to watch it but was not fond of it. It had some good ideas and sometimes a plot of some interest but often was extremely boring with low production values. The problem was not so much the actors as the director and writers, I had the feeling they did not even enjoy the genre. Some will likely disagree but your money would be so much better spent on old and new versions of the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, then Boris Karloff's Thriller, Friday the 13th - the series, Poltergist - the Legacy, Supernatural, Ray Bradbury Theatre, Tales from the Darkside and so forth."
positive,Large book,"yes, this missal is big. Its is very thick, but it does serve its purpose. I don't use it at Mass, as I use another form of Missal, but this is a nice book to have for home review."
positive,"Good, cheesy fun","I bought this product because I remember watching the series when it was on and thinking that it was good, clean, cheesy fun with some of my favorite TV characters of all time."
negative,'Canned' percussion and organ!,"Leo! What happened? Why the percussion drone from 'a can', are you trying to get a 'disco beat' to your music? And what happened to the tempo? Are you getting old? Cripple Creek accompanied by an organ? Come on! And this is the only up-beat song on the CD. Chet Atkins playing the lead guitar on your CD? I'll buy one of his CD's if I want to hear him play! 'Corina, Corina' is way too smooth, what happened to the guy who sang 'Pamela Brown'? Give me the younger Leo, straightforward great tempo and just 6 strings - 12 strings only when they are strung to one guitar. And a baritone voice of course, darker than the blackest coffee."
negative,great show but badly cast for video,"Having seen J&H 4 times on Broadway I was looking forward to having it on video to watch when I pleased. However, the joy quickly turned to disappointment with the cast that was used for the video/telecast. Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder were - in a word - superb. Ms Eder has the voice and presence the video lacks. Cuccioli is a splendid actor whose transformation of Jekyll to Hyde was thrilling and far beyond the ability of Mr. Baywatch. Cuccioli, with use of body language and voice, makes two different characters believeable. His dialog between Jekyll and Hyde near the end was remarkable. Not so the video.Stick with the Broadway recording and let's HOPE someone has the sense to film it with Eder and Cuccioli."
negative,"Absolutely horrible alien movie, with no aliens.","This was a sorry attempt at a love movie slash alien flick. They incorporated two lame duck actors (although the chick was semi=attractive) with some octopus' they flaunted as aliens and came up with a catchy name for a title. It should have been titled ""Sucks"" cause this movie did. I had more fun pooping."
negative,Letdown in VA,This is the worse CD. It showsthe Dixie Chicks were right abouthim being ignorant. Wish I hadread the reviews before I boughtthis CD on release day. The lasttwo were so good but this is a big letdown and waste of money.
positive,great practicality,"I recently began using this attachment with my Dremel to create prescise lines at uniform depths. Using this attachment, I was able to achieve the results I was looking for. The variable depth is very helpful, but a little inaccurate. Still, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a simple, but very helpful attachment for their Dremel."
positive,HDMI vs Optical Audio Input,"I am looking to assemble a HDTV, Blu-Ray player and speaker set that will last me for the next 3 - 5 years. I was initially drawn to this speaker based on reviews, but have one question.It is my impression that the speaker itself is awesome, but that the lack of an HDMI in/out compromises the potential of the speaker to deliver the best sound from an HD source. In other words, sound coming from a Blu-Ray or cable box loses some signal through the digital optical cable, which would otherwise not happen with an HDMI cable. Could people please comment/educate? Is the lack of HDMI inputs the reason for the drastic price reduction?I have not had a chance to compare audio coming out of optical audio vs HDMI, and so do not have a basis to establish if holding out for HDMI is worth the extra money that that might entail.Thank you."
negative,The most overrated movie ever made!,"I did indeed sit through all 57 hours of the Godfather and not only is it one of the most boring movies ever made it's completely pointless garbage. I have no clue why it's considered the greatest film ever made but then again most people are dumb so yea no suprise. The only good thing about this film is the music, if you haven't seen it don't buy into the hype that's all it is hype... BUT if you have insomnia put this movie in you should be asleep within the first 30 minutes."
positive,Great with something missing,"The truth is that Barenboim has made the CSO a better orchestra than where it could go with Solti. He has given it emotion. It is an uphill battle and Chicago hasn't thanked him for it. Whatever sort of man Barenboim is, he is a deeply emotive interpreter or Brahms. In 15 years or so, I hope he comes back and re-records these to show where he has gone. Not his greatest work, but very powerful stuff and worth owning if you love a rainy Saturday with those wonderful third movement horns."
negative,No quality control,"The whole track 12 had the tick sound of the metronome, that is very annoying does'nt matter how good the rest of the CD is. And the policy can not return an open CD does not help either."
negative,An achievement!,"This may be the worst book ever written; hopeless writing, pretentious, non-linear narrative, and no horror.I'm not picky about writing. I read lots of dreck. I'll muddle through awkward metaphors for the sake of a good plot, or a good scare. I'll also ignore sloppy plotting if the writing is good. I slogged all the way through this silly, silly book to discover that *it doesn't have an ending* it just sort of leaves things hanging like an art film.Horrifying, really."
positive,Always a 5,"What can I say? AB-FABS are, and always will be my favorites. This DVD was the last in the series I have in VHF. My hope, is that they will come up with another series."
positive,I haven't understood anything since 1962,The first book I have ever read in my 55 years that actually made me laugh out loud while reading. This is the funniest book since the Clinton administration or the Gore/Bush election. Truely hilarious!
negative,Would not recommend for beginners,"I read the book first thinking it would be different from the CD. Then I played the CD and it's as if the woman is reading from the book. I was disapointed. If you understand the positions of yoga, this is a good CD for your daily practice. However, I would recommend a DVD for beginners so they can see the instructor and how to position their body.I also did not find the CD motivating. It's as if the instructor just reads the position to you. I prefer a classroom setting where I can see the instructor and vice versa. Instructors understand we have good days and bad and will provide more motivation."
negative,Save your $$ - Re-issue,"While I REALLY liked the stories contained in this book - I was disappointed to discover this was a reissue of stories previously issued in the book ""Everlasting Love"". ""Everlasting"" included two additional stories although it was issued in 1995. Good marketing ploy however."
positive,Pump necessary,After I purchased the tank I attempted to fill a generator. I was told that the 225 pound tank (when full) needs to be higher than where its going into. I needed to purchase an additional pump for about $150.00. Great quality otherwise.
positive,Bobby & The Binx,"I bought this CD 4 years ago while traveling in Germany, and I still break it out on a regular basis. The bass is deep and pure. There is a uniqueness about it that that makes it stand out. Not a substitute if you know what I mean."
negative,Too short,"Like many other reviewers have stated, avoid this product if you would like it to cover your ears and you are older than 10. It seems to be a quality stiched product and thats why it receives two stars. Additionaly, like previously stated it is thinner than other fleece caps I have had in the past. Save your money and find one that fits correctly!"
positive,Worth reading,"I'm almost sad that this book is fiction. I always liked imagining that Jesus had a best friend by His side throughout the majority of His life. I could go on in a lot of detail, but I fear the response of fanatics from both sides of the spectrum, so I will just say this: Read this book if you, like me, imagined that there was at lease one human being who didn't want anything from Jesus; he or she just wanted to be His friend."
negative,broken first day,"I bought this hoping that it would be a superior Kitchenaid product. My last Kitchenaid blender lasted for about 20 uses! Unfortunately, I didn't use it often so it was way out of warranty. It was a very different design so stupidly I thought that with all the good reviews this one would be different.After making my first smoothie, I filled the container with water and a little soap as the directions suggested to clean and it all started running out the bottom all over the counter. The whole blade assembly was loose. Then my husband looked at it and not only was it loose but the gasket was not in the right place.Needless to say it is going back to the store and I am not buying another Kitchenaid blender. I love my kitchenAid mixer and food processor but they just can't get this design right!"
negative,"Purple, Green and Yellow","I ordered Purple Green and Yellow for my Grandaughter. As a former Media Specialist I have read it to many kids and it has become a favorite. I was surprised at the $1.99 price tag but thought it must be a great sale price! NOT!!! It was a TINY little book, maybe 3"" X 3"". Not at all what I thought I was getting. I feel like I was duped! Thanks Amazon!"
positive,A Southern Laid Back Style with a Female Private Eye,"This is a pretty decent mystery. It has a southern laid backstyle with an intelligent female protagonist. I like the wayit dealt with gay people in small towns, politics in the south,the the interconnectedness of people tied together by family,geography and history."
positive,Nice mix of history and fiction,"I enjoyed this book by Ms. Due. I was especially impressed with the use of real historical facts about Scott Joplin intertwined with the fictional ghost story. Ms Due always takes the reader on a journey which makes you feel like a part of the story. You simply can not wait to see what happens. In all honesty in my opinion this book didn't flow as well as her other books, but I still think it is a winner and as usual I always enjoy good speculative fiction from Black authors. I can't wait for her next book."
negative,Poor Design,"You cannot listen to messages and use the receiver at the same time. Picking up the reciever automatically disconnects anything the machine is doing. If the reciever is off the hook and runs out of juice, then the whole system (including the answering machine) will not work. The handset is also ill-designed as you cannot lean on it like a regular phone lest you immediately disconnect whomever you are speaking with. When sending faxes, machine sometimes grabs more than 1 page you are tying to send. Look carefully to ensure all pages were sent. Only 8 minute tape. I don't recommend."
positive,MUST READ!,Compelling piece of work. Lehr's writing style is blunt and fun to read. Bridget Jones who? Sex and the City who? What an emotional roller coaster that all of us can relate too in one-way-or-another.
negative,Rama II and Rama III are awful.,"Rama II and Rama III are awful. I'm embarrassed to see Mr. Clarke's name associated with these so-called sequels. They reflect nothing of the science fiction wonder and imagination seen in Rendezvous with Rama and most of his other stories. Rama II & III are completely polluted with political, sociological & religious nonsense and modern emotionalism. Not worth reading. Certainly not worth adding to a fine collection of Clarke books."
negative,Not enough new Info,"This book although useful in its own right as a reference tool for a star wars fan is useless to the owner of an earlier revision. This book did not include very many things and is poorly organized. The content it does have is good and can be very helpful, but it is lacking loads of information on recent books and comics."
positive,GOOD READ!!!!,"I LIKED THIS BOOK, ALTHOUGH I HATED TO READ ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES THAT ANNETTE SUFFERED THROUGH AS A CHILD. WHAT DOES NOT KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER AND THAT IS EXACTLLY WHAT IT DID WITH ANNETTE. IT ALSO HELPED THAT SHE HAD THE SHOULDER OF HER BEST FRIEND, RHODA, TO LEAN ON. THEY STUCK TOGETHER WHEN THEY NEEDED EACHOTHER THE MOST. THIS BOOK HAS IT'S SHARE OF DRAMA AND IT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT!!! THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT YOU HAVE TO READ IT TO FIND OUT!!!!!"
negative,Rare to find a Dummies author with such uninformed views,"There's a good Dummies book to be written about timesharing, but this isn't it.The author's bias as a former timeshare salesperson repeatedly shows as she justifies the ridiculously inflated prices charged for developer timeshares and nudges the reader in the direction.Her bias as an Orlando resident -- and salesperson at TS Orlando properties -- causes her to push that area as the most valuable place to buy a timeshare, but most folks familiar with timesharing would tell you Orlando is already overbuilt and has poor resale and trading value.Just a disappointing read."
negative,disappointed,This is an aesthetically pleasing toy.It is big and colorful and makes neat noises.but.....It is cumbersomeImpossible to transform in under and HOURNot much use to play with other than to transform it.Once transformed its parts wiggle so it doesn't stay transformed.It is made of plastic and VERY easily brokenthere are some small parts to choke onThis would be fine if all you want to do is use it as a decoration.
negative,suprisingly disappointed,"I was excited to get Sheryl's new CD, but found it quite boring. As a woman who is the same age as Sheryl, I can relate to where she is emotionally. There is a sense of ease and relaxation that comes with being in your 40's, and I can hear it in her songs. But I was hoping to hear more of her upbeat songs like ""Steve McQueen"", ""C'mon C'mon"", or ""Soak up the Sun"". Many of the songs on this CD sound a lot like other songs she has done, but with different lyrics! Sure, I'll listen to this now and then, but it definately won't be a favorite. I will put her ""Very Best of Sheryl Crow"" on before I put this one on. This CD was more of a sleeper."
negative,Wrong photo for the item,"Unfortunately, I was after the aftershave.... Not the spray on Eau de Toilette.Guys, it's critical to have the right photo for the items you sell.Also, why is it so damned hard to find quorum aftershave splash?"
positive,okay slip,"This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially in this case."
negative,"0 Stars!!! Whack,Whack Album!!!",Go back to the OC where you belong and leave hip hop to Eminem and Paul Wall!!!!!!!He thinks he's a Bad Bad Man.More like Gay Gay Man to me!I don't care if you think I'm hatin' on this Wigger!!!!I can see you and your gay/white self!
negative,Not the Real Discs,"Couldn't say it better than another reviewer listed. These are DVD-R's with a label popped on them and sold as the series. No Menus, nothing... if you want to get to the second episode on the disc, good luck, you have to skip chapters and fast forward. AWFUL."
positive,Angel Messages,"Perfect! Absolutely perfect! The book and cards fit very well into my own healing work. Comfortable, low key, simple, with messages from the Masters. Anyone, regardless of personal belief system will benefit from these thought-provoking words of hope, comfort and joy. Well written and easy to work with."
negative,Horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen. It follows the book well, but is horrible (unlike the book). The guy from Mighty Ducks, Amelio Arestaves or whatever and whoever plays Dally are the only good actors. Dreadful stuff...It doesn't make sense. Good Book, good other books, good other movies, but this one is horrible. Don't waste your time. Read the book."
positive,SpaSilk tank onesies,"I love these and will order more. I read another review that said they ran big, but I found that they run True to size. I have an average size baby and she fit into her size by age. Quality is great. They later well."
negative,someone better bury this DVD in the weeds,"Excellent film - horrible, horrible DVD. Shameful really. But who cares, right? Throw 'em a bone and the money will roll right in. I wish Criterion would get a hold of this one. Nowhere to go but up."
positive,Fun,"Fun puzzle, although the pieces didn't lock together as well as I would've liked. I enjoyed the different sections and colors."
negative,"my mom loved it, bless her heart","The popularity of this film is one of life's great mysteries to me.I wanted to like it for Mom's sake. Alas, it came off like a third rate soap opera. See other one star reviews."
negative,Do Not waste your money or your time!,The movie starts out really goofy and she is an avid drinker. The front of the DVD looks fun and Christmas like. NOT!
negative,Too Over the Top,I bought this book because of Amiaya Entertainmentbackground. This book was horrible. The story line was so unbelieveable and the dramatic killings could have been left out. I think this author is incarcerated and he has too much time on his hands. This book was so unbelieveable and there was not a main focus on the characters. I would not request anyone to purchase this book.
positive,"to ""a music fan""","The song you mean is ""chain of fools."" The ""chang chang chang"" is really ""chain chain chain."" It's an old Aretha Franklin song that is often butchered by American Idol contestants...This is a great album. I love the Ramones song ""Bonzo goes to Bitburg."" I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes good rock music."
positive,good for its size,These are good speakers if you are looking for something small. They are a little bassy at higher volumes.
negative,"I'm A Cold Fan, But....","I wanted to like this record, I really did. But to be honest, it's one of the more over-hyped, disappointing releases outside the realm of Metallica. Now we've all heard the heavy sing along chorus of ""Stupid Girl"" and it's a great song. Too bad the rest of the album has no such other redeeming moments. I'm not one of these guys who hates bands that try something different. Hell, I even consider myself a big time Cold fan. ""13 Ways"" was a killer record with lots of different material on it. The bleakness is still here, on songs like ""Cure My Tragedy"" and ""Suffocate."" But the spark of there previous work is noticeably absent. Other songs, like the tribute number ""The Day Seattle Died"" and the laughable ""Kill the Music Industry"" seem very ponderous and almost pretentious. Too bad, Cold has a ton of talent, but here they're just going through the motions."
positive,love this author,"this book was not as good as book 1 but i love the main character and this author! i felt like the whole greek mafia thing was a little much but the books are entertaining and being a psychic junkie myself, i find them very interesting."
negative,Poorly made,"I had ordered a 16"" disco ball several years ago, unfortunately it was stolen and after several failed attempts to purchase from the same vendor I ordered this one through Amazon and as it was being hung new from the box, several mirror tiles fell off I had it replaced. The new ball arrived very quickly and although the mirror tiles are not falling off it looks like a 3rd grader placed the mirror tiles on the ball. I am keeping it since its my replacement ball and hopefully no one will notice the poor craftsmanship way up at the ceiling, but am not happy at all with the quality."
negative,"Not even 1 star...deserves a ""0 star"" rating if that were possible...","I'd heard great things about this movie, that it's ""very disturbing"" and that it's a ""classic."" My husband is not a fan of older movies and he needed a little convincing before I was able to get him to watch it with me. I regretted it not long after the movie began. This is THE most awful movie I have ever seen. My husband kept telling me to turn it off, but I kept telling him to wait a bit longer, that the movie will become more interesting. When the credits rolled, we actually had a fight!"
negative,Stinky,"This system is hard to change at first but then you get the hang of it. My problem was the smell after about eight months it starts to have an odor. I bleached it, sprayed it, etc. it helped a few days but still the smell is there. I am finally getting rid of it and looking for something else."
positive,Very cute!,"This was a very cute and entertaining book about dating ALL the wrong men and finding out what is important and when enough is enough! IF I were her, I would have given up long ago! Everything from the cab driver to Elliot.It also dealt with family and how important their role is in your life. It proves you may think you are happy to pretend to be someone else, but in the end you are better off being yourself.And heck in the end, if all else fails, go buy a dog!!!! Enjoy!"
positive,an album you just gotta hear !,"Buddy Guy - A Man & The Blues, Vanguard Records, 1968Here is ""THE"" template for modern blues inspired performers!. This album is the template for what musicologists refer to as the ""second generation Chicago Blues"". Buddy's performance on his fender Stratocaster will transport you into a smoke filled seedy Chicago bar where the you will get the blues. There are tons of great blues players and albums out there but this one is just kinda extra extra special. One listen and you will know what I mean !"
positive,Loved it!,This is a must read! I found it to be the best book on mutual funds out there. It really takes all of the confusion out of funds and makes for a great Internet companion
positive,Strapless,An enchanting movie starring Blair Brown as an American doctor practicing in England. Brigette Fonda plays her younger sister. Hugh Laurie plays one of thedoctors she works with.
negative,unsatisfied.,"earrings were not as expected, seemed smaller, and fake. (although these claims were not investigated, the earrings were returned.) the box seemed handmade. but, fast shipping, and overall good customer service when i returned the item."
negative,Mr. Bean: The Ultimate Collection,Very disapointed that half of the CDs are cartoons... animated...I cannot find anywhere that states this fact about the CDs...
negative,Personally not a big fan of the apple,I am a big fan of gonesh so I gave this one a try and overall it just didn't do it for me.
negative,Utter Waste of Money,"We have yet to meet a cat or dog who isn't afraid of this thing. The consensus among owners I've discussed this with is that the cheap Chinese-made pump is likely emitting audio frequencies (inaudible to humans) that offend the keen sense of hearing of animals.If you really want to believe the positive reviews, go ahead and get one, but, keep all the packaging and be prepared to return it within the allowable return window."
positive,pretty neat!,"a bit quirky but the sound is surprisingly good. It would be nice if the Ipod menu showed up on the screen and if the controls managed all of teh Ipod functions, but I like it! Good to use in the care as the controls are big and where I live it works much better than an FM transmitter. For lss than $100 this is a real bargain! (if you have the Ipod)"
positive,Paper Heart DVD,"I bought this for my husband's birthday. He saw the trailer on another DVD that we were watching. The item arrived new and on time based on the shipping information. It was a fun DVD, cute and well made for what it is (mockumentary). The ending was a little disappointing though."
negative,"Hurt my eyes, no cushion at all!","I am a Masters swimmer and wanted to try different goggles than TYR femme, etc. I am in need of goggles for a narrow face, thought these might be the ones. They sit straight on the eye socket bone around the eyes and hurt - can't imagine what they would be like in the water when the suction takes hold. Amazon's delivery was practically at my door before I ordered these, outstanding. Unfortunately the product is going back."
negative,More Used Than Advertised,"This item came from one of Amazon's third party vendors. That vendor claimed the book was in Good condition. Obviously there is a broad definition of the word Good. This book should have been rated fair to poor. At least it had all the pages, but there is writing in the book, highlighting, stained pages (water spill?) and other detractors. On the back cover it even said Very Good, I only hope they meant the story and not the condition.So beware of purchasing used books from some of these vendors, they use condition descriptions very loosly."
negative,Can't finish,"""You ever been raped? Want to try it?""The 'hero' asks Lora this after he strips, gags, and ties her to a bed. I'm only 65 pages in but I won't be reading any more of this book. Personally I do not find threats of rape and eventual Stockholm Syndrome sexy. And it's pretty disturbing to find these things, not in true crime or psychological thriller, but in the romantic suspense genre."
negative,Maybe you'll have better luck than I,This went hay wire after a few months of use. The batteries were expensive also. I don't recommend this product but maybe I just got a faulty one. The control features were nice.
positive,Excellent mix of house and african music,"If you liked Cheb I Sabbah's ""La Kahena"" you'll probably dig this too."
positive,Essential for a nursing student that needs organization!,This planner is perfect- it has two styles of calendars so you can choose which one (monthly or daily/by week) and has a quick reference for all your needs. kind of bulky but it is one book instead of 2 or 3...
positive,almost emo heaven,tell everyone we're dead os one of the promise ring's best songs.however best looking boys and especially american girl are not.still buy it anyway
positive,Fantastic,"I have had this product for a couple years. I am an Over the road truck driver and it stays on 24/7. Bottom line Fantastic! Good price, always works. Best investment I ever made."
negative,Not buying it.,"This isn't really a review so much as a mini-proclamation. I won't be buying this DVD set. I love the original trilogy and, for me, the running changes add nothing to my enjoyment of it. In fact, they stick out so much that I find I cannot watch the film for being distracted by the changes. So, buy it if you must. Heck, I even hope some of you enjoy it. Me? I won't drop another dime into the Lucas Film vault. Not until the original Original Trilogy, warts and all, is released."
positive,"Ok, but not spectacular","The notes are short and concise and contain everything you need to know (and perhaps a little extra stuff) for the test. However in my opinion the practice tests were not really like the real thing. There is a lack of questions on laboratory and descriptive chemistry, of which quite a lot of questions come out in the real test. Use this with a chemistry textbook to get best results."
negative,cheap and unreliable,"I bought this as a replacement for a PC GPS that burnt out after several years of hard use, and this one just does not cut it. It tends to lose lock with the sats very easily, the position it does give is often running 100+ meters off (for those that know what it means, I think the thing is usually pulling a FOM 6 or 8... wide margin of error), and the body is so cheaply made that after a month, the case has split.Get something else for your GPS needs."
positive,So Much Fun,"Hi, I am 11 years old. My friend has one of these, and he let me try it and i asked some questions on it and they were true! I would say that the magic 8 ball is 90% correct!"
negative,toooo simple,"I suppose this DVD would be good if you are an extremely repressed housewife, but otherwise, skip it! They should spend less time telling people its okay to act sexy and more time showing interesting moves. If you want to learn to dance sexy, I recommend any of Neena and Veena's belly dancing tapes. You'll learn more from 5 minutes there than from this entire hour-long tape."
positive,Self-Relief,I windsurf. That means the bod requires some therapy. Theracane is a huge addition to my stash of body tools. It's powerful; can get to places that other tools cannot. This thing is major. Get one.
negative,This is a waste of money,"I have been an eczema sufferer for 30 years. I tried this product as a last ditch effort as the testimonials and reviews were so promising. I have been using this product for a week now, halfs of the jar is gone and I have seen no difference whatsoever. Please do not get your hopes up. I am anxious to see how hard it will be to get my money back as I have read several times that the customer service stinks."
positive,A Spatula for display,"This is a very well made turner. Just like all of the All-Clad kitchen utensils I have purchased. It is of very nice stainless steel. It was the reason I started displaying my cook ware. It is construced very sturdy and it is comfortable in the hand. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I think the angle to the head from the handle should be a little sharper to fit in skillets better and the edge is not beveled. I took my sharpening stones and gave the front of the spatula a bevel, so it slides under food better, and I enjoy it much better now."
positive,Birthday Pary Cake Toy,"My 4 year old loves this toy. She has shown more interest in this toy than in most of her other toys. My only fear is the paint since it was made in China. I suspect it has been painted with leaded paint, but I don't know for sure, so I just make sure she doesn't put any of the pieces in her mouth. Everything about it is cute and pretty. She loves bringing me pieces of cake several times a day. I would give it 100% rating if I felt comfortable about the paint."
negative,Fragile and didn't last 24 hours,"I hate to be so down on a product, but this treadmill broke the first time we used it.For the price, you'd be better off buying a stationary bike from a used sporting goods store. My husband picked this out, thinking he'd like it more than the electric treadmill (he doesn't like the noise, I wear headphones when I use it). But it was wobbly, he thought the wobbliness would disappear once he was walking, but instead it broke.Major disappointment."
positive,Great for young boys,This is a great magazine for young boys who have any interest in sports. My boys read and re-read it until it is falling apart. We now buy it as a gift for all their friends who are interested in sports and do not already get it.
positive,Ummmmm...gross,"This film has sub-par acting, poor production quality, and unsettling violence. Combined together they create a dark and eerie cinematic experience that is thoroughly enjoyable to a serious horror fan, not despite the low quality but because of it. It's not meant for mass consumption but if you are looking for a dim and grainy vision of terror this is the ticket."
negative,Trouble with a great Palm,"The Palm TX is an awesome idea. Unfortunately, the one I purchased from Amazon last week (June 06) was defective (severe flicker on the screen), and the replacement they sent me was also defective (screen will not calibrate to stylus). Although Amazon customer service has been excellent, I have to say I am pretty disappointed. I am going to try a third Palm, but I might buy it locally instead, to prevent (possible) shipping damage. I did buy a protection plan on the Palm - I highly recommend doing so."
negative,Filter doesn't fit,"I received the Brita filter as a wedding gift. To my surprise, the filter does not fit. The water just runs around the filter into the pitcher which defeats the purpose. I am very disappointed."
positive,A good look back,"During the tumultuous period of the 60s when author Dennis Smith wrote Report From Engine Company 82, the book was a cry for help from exhausted, frustrated men. Men who cleaned up in the aftermath of other exhausted and frustrated inhabitants of a society stretched to the breaking point.As I type this, a younger firefighter in a comfortable, air-conditioned fire station among a population that by-and-large respects my profession, it's easy to forget the sacrifice of our past brothers who unceasingly fought fires, city hall and the population they served, until they had forged the modern fire service.It's an important book for new firefighters to learn how the iron men of old did the job. And for the general reader it's a testament to both a volatile period in our nation's history, and to the timeless strength and courage by which good men have always worked to keep back the chaos of barbarism and destruction."
negative,The Seat of Your Pants,"I was very happy with Dancing Wu Li and looked forward to an insightful journey into our inner selves. Unfortunately, this book came up wanting. A few uncited William James, Augustine and eastern philosophy references, mixed with Jung and Thermodynamics does not show Zukov to have either the inclination or the understanding of philosophical thought that has come before. He provides no point of reference for his argument and no personal transcendent experience. In sum, a waste of money. More Karma is available with the astrological section of the newspaper. Don't buy this book and feed poor work."
positive,Great book,"I bought the book The Hiding Place because I had the lost the one I had. I greatly enjoyed the book. It is well written, and Historical. Her story is one that should never be forgotten. The book was in great shape when I got it."
positive,Good VCR,"I own two of the Sanyo versions of these VCR's. They were manufactured as the SANYO vwm-950, and the Sylvania 6260vd. I have had one of these VCR's for 2 1/2 years now, and one for just over one year. Both are working well, play great, with good picture and sound. I have them fed into my surround sound system, and it is excellent to watch movies with. I highly recommend this vcr for a low cost good output, and reliable way to play your old videos. 4 heads, stereo input and output, easy to set up and use. Check these out, good buy."
negative,A very ordinary effort,"This book does not take you through quantum computing in any logical way. The author does not explain where he is going with his lengthy examples in each section. Instead he tends to launch into hard to follow, artificially concocted examples with little rationale and then move to the next topic without a conclusion or a reason for why he put the reader through such boring experience. The discussion of the Bohr - Einstein debate told me nothing of what the debate was about and there are many references to the EPR without any real explanation of what was in it. There must be a better way to understand this subject else I will have to conclude that Einstein was right and God really does play dice. Give this book a miss... it is simply not worth the effort. Even my one star is generous."
negative,too big,maybe i have a small head.. i dont know. but these are ill fitting. glad mamazon gave me a refund.
positive,Great book!,"If you like Gordon Ramsay (or even if you don't know who he is) but think his recipes are too hard for a normal household cook, this book is for you! He takes some really simple dishes and makes them look like something prepared in a 3 Michelin Star restaurant. He has pictures to show how the dishes should look for presentation purposes and he's very succinct and to the point. He also takes more elegant recipes and makes them so it's food that we can do at home. Well worth the purchase!!"
positive,Enjoy it for fun or education,"Have you ever watched a movie that made you anticipate the next scene so much it gave you goose bumps? This is just that sort of movie. It is fast paced, exciting, historically accurate, fun, and educational.The Medici were among the ruling families in Florence, Italy during the Renaissance era. The ruling families made their own laws and everything, including murder, was legal. Learn how the Medici's rose to the prominence of the most powerful positions in Florence, while Brunelleschi created the dome for the Florence Cathedral.As an art historian I am always interested in DVDs to show my students. Many are not worth the time and money but this one definately is. It is one of the best I have seen."
negative,Description not true and quality is bad,"I purchased the item for my son for Halloween. The item is described as Boy's size 4-6. My son is 5 and he is considered small (about 3 ft and 2 inches tall) for his age but the suit fitted him just right. There is no way any six year old boy could have fitted in that suit. Secondly, the zipper was broken the moment my son put the suit on. The item is definitely not quality made."
negative,Not equal to The Summer Country!,"This book is the continuation of James Hetley's The Summer Country. This time around we barely ever leave The Summer Country, while in Oak's predecessor we visited the normal world quite often. The plot centers on Maureen dealing with the repurcussions of the death of Dougal and her battle with Fiona. During this process, Maureen falls into the clutches of her old friend, alcohol, which can't be good...I only gave this book two stars because only the last fifty pages are worth reading, the rest of the book drags ON and ON. This will be worth the money for fans of The Summer Country but everyone else would be best advised to stay away from this book! Hope that helped.-Bohema"
negative,@#$@Y%#,"because humans make movies like this, we would be prime for aliens to come use us for target practice. my goodness, i thought my eyes were lying to me.this movie is like smelling a nasty azz fart with your eyes.I quote my sterling review of battlefield earth as it directly is applicable to this piece of cr@p:""if aliens ever attacked earth, we could show them this movie and they would leave. ""nuff said."
negative,Junk,"This movie was completely idiotic. The entire idea of the angels not being able to feel was mishandled (see the ""What does a pear taste like?"" scene. How is someone who could never taste supposed to know what ""sugary sand"" tastes like? But Cage's character just nods. Terrible.) The ""plot twist"" was ridiculous. And yes, the angels do look ominous. Meg Ryan was miscast as a heart surgeon. This is simply not worth watching. However, as a result of this crappy movie, I have been introduced to Wim Wender's version, which I will check out as it sounds far superior. The one star is for that."
positive,heart rate monitor,"I am an older road biker and have been climbing some long hills. I was concerned about my heart rate.I didn't want to die trying to stay healthy.The Omron HR-100C had good reviews and was well priced. I like the mounting bracket that fits nicely on the handlebar. I've been using it now for a couple of weeks and it works pefectly. I wet the heart sensers for good contact. This might not be necessary because i'm sweating after awhile anyway.By the way my heart rate tops out at 140, so I guess I'll keep on living."
negative,Joe Dirt,I would give this no stars if possible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. David Spade proves not only that he was the least talented cast member while on Saturday Night Live but also that he can't make a funny movie without someone to carry him (Chris Farley). Save your money. Not funny at all; I could barely sit through it.
negative,Not molded correctly,"I bought Husky Liners for my 2012 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab. They appear to have been molded for an older model or something because they don't fit. Example is the ""pedal"" on the left side of the drivers side. It creates a big lump under the mat which does not accomodate that. The mat is molded for a flat space. Perhaps the mats were molded for a manual transmission? Not sure. But they just don't fit well."
positive,A must listen to by all to improve yourself and others,"This audio is for everyone, who wants to try to understand people, especially your spouse and children. I have listened to this five times, and I am still learning, as this tape gives examples with other people in the audio that makes it quite interesting. One situation was when both people were in love, got married then turned around to only be a one sided love. Gary Chapman coached the one person and helped two, and understanding that each of us has things, we love more than the other does. We have been married for forty-six years and I found out how to make it even better, with listening to this tape. The best!"
negative,"Too glossy, no meat","I was expecting a little more substance from the book, perhaps some deeper examples and some better analysis and dirt and gossip from the wackoes that ran these dot coms, but the book was no more than a listing with a blurb at best on a whole stack of companies that went under. The blurbs were funny to read at first, but get old and dull pretty fast, and the whole thing ends up being a fun read for no more than 10 pages. It's a shame, I would think there's a lot of good dirt to dredge up and write about, and I was hoping this would touch on that, but it doesn't. I would skip this one."
positive,THIS DVD FREAKING ROCKS!!!,"Jillian is the real deal people! I've done this dvd twice so far, and I feel the difference in my body. I love this so much becuase Jillian has you all over the place with core strengthen and cardio wrapped up into one. I have neck pain when doing certain ab excercises, but this workout didn't aggrevate my neck at all. You will not get bored while sweating your butt off. My stomach is the last frontier of getting my body into shape, and working with Jillian will make it happen. The best part of the DVD was at the end as she talked to you during the cool down. She really made you feel proud of yourself, and wanting to work even harder next go around.I'm on level 1 at the moment, and can't wait to see how challenge level 2 will be on week 4. I was always skeptical of her on the Biggest Loser, but now I'm a true fan :-)"
positive,I hate it but I love it!,"It is my first John Grishams book. I get the book from myAustralian co-worker when come to US for a meeting. Thisbook turns me into a Grishams book fan overnight.The book is easy to read but hard to put down. It forcesmy hand to into a page turning machine. The characters inthe book can be found in real life. A kid, father, lawyer,judge, black folks, KKK members and journalists, all runinto each other life and create all the tensions and loves.It is a good book to read but you will hate it because itstop you from doing everything else."
negative,The Mind: Its Multiple Projections & Multiple Facets,"I wasn't too thrilled with this book. I'm not into early morning meditations or into crazy diets. It might be great for anybody else, but I did not like the book at all."
negative,CHINESE JUNK,THIS IS NOT THE CAN OPENER YOUR MOTHER HAD. THIS IS A CHINESE KNOCK OFF. WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MOS. NOW THE SOFT METAL GEARS AND CUTTER WON'T OPEN CANS. WE USE THIS IN A HOME KITCHEN AND IT HAS NOT BEEN MISUSED IN ANY WAY. I HAVE 2 OF THE HAND HELD CAN OPENERS BY SWING A WAY THEY ALSO SUFFER FROM METAL FATIGUE. THEY STILL WORK BUT NO BETTER THAN ONE FROM THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. THEY ALL STARTED OUT FINE BUT THE CHEAP METAL SOON GAVE OUT. BUYER BEWARE!!!
positive,Great Book,This book was a quick read but very interesting! Before I was never interested in circuses but now I am! Enjoy the show!
positive,This was one of his best,"Lewis is at boy-scout camp while he has left Rose Rita home by herself. So Miss. Zimmermann takes her on a road trip. As they go through a tunnel, they go to a different world!"
positive,having a spare saves the day,"I travel a lot so I need to take a charger with me; on occasion, I've either forgotten it at my host's house or even misplaced it entirely. Having a extra charger helps me avoid the dreaded dead battery in my dog's training collar - now I can leave one charger in one outlet at all times.For the occasionally absent-minded pet-mom, this spare is an absolute essential."
negative,Corn Flakes with a Twist,"I found this item while searching for Granola and Berries and looked forward to it's arrival. However, I was very disappointed with the abundance of corn flakes. Like other reviewers the amount of granola crumbs is disheartening too. The Triple Berries are yummy and I would have enjoyed this WITHOUT the cornflakes. There's too many cornflakes to pick out...yes the thought crossed my mind!"
negative,Painfully boring....,"I won't be redundant and restate what my fellow reviewers have so eloquently stated about the snooze factor inherent in this book. However, I will give kudos to Mr. Clancy for taking care of my occasional insomnia. Ten pages of Red Rabbit puts me to sleep faster than any pill ever could. Thanks Tom!!!Don't waste your money. There are many authors that have become much more capable than Clancy. I just read Wings Of Fire by Dale Brown and could not put the book down...fantastic!!"
positive,An exciting talent.,"SELF HELP is a collection of short stories focusing on lost love and infidelity . Brilliant imagery and cleverly manipulated semantics dominate.Narrative is neglected, but not really missed.Each piece must be slowly savored, and carefully parsed.My only reservation is the ever pervasive cynicism and hopeless view of human relationships.Perhaps Moore's other work will have a wider range and more optimistic outlook. This is my first taste of Moore."
positive,Good Product,This DVD was recommended by my sister and I can say that it really hits the mark. I use this when I'm on business trips and it is great for a change in pace.
negative,A WASTE,"The cleaance price ""told"" me these would be ""dated"". However, I did NOT expect to get totally scentless GARBAGE."
negative,Needs to be fixed,"I'm on my second pump and it has failed too. The problem with this pump is that the rubber gasket that protects the motor fails. It's not sealed properly and water will get inside the electrical parts. Once this happens, your GFI and/or circuit breaker will trip and the pump will turn off. I took apart the first one and found this out. I dried it out and plugged it back in. It worked. I then used aquarium sealant and sealed the motor from getting any water inside. I now have 2 pumps that work since doing this. They told me to throw away the first one. This pump would be 5 stars if it didn't break so quick. All they need to do is seal the motor better and it's a great pump. It may last 6 months at most before the gasket fails. I've had it running for 2 years now after fixing it and I have a back up waiting if it does break."
negative,don't be fooled by the wahl name here,"I decided to try out something different from the Philips Norelco, and decided to go with another good name brand, Wahl, or so I thought. This thing should be pulled from amazon. The attachments are crap. Thin cheap plastic, hard to put on and take off. I had to pry it against the counter top to get it to come off. The multi height attachment is poorly designed. With a curved head design depending on what angle you hold it at, it will cut different lengths! Despite all this, the trimmer it self pulls at your hair. I couldn't get through one trimming of my goatee with out it painfully pulling my hair over five times in two minutes. I sent it back. I got the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, this thing works wonders!!! Just want I wanted from a trimmer."
positive,I love this book,"I love this book and have bought it as a present for many special friends one of whom started to use it as a teaching aid for young children learning French. At Christmas, it's a great stocking stuffer. I have a copy on my desk and a few spares in a drawer to give visitors who become enthralled. You don't need to be a cat lover. My own view of cats is that they are a species with what Americans call, 'lots of attitude'. Churchill said that they looked down on all humans whom they consider to be their servants. I have had many in my life and my present cat has more attitude than most."
negative,Jack on the tracks review,"What could have been a funny story is severly marred by the author's twisted sense of humor when it comes to the killing of animals. Three times, Jack's cats are killed, due to his lack of responsibility, and each time the author wants us to laugh it off. It's just not funny. It's too bad, because otherwise it could have been a funny book that kids would enjoy and as a Librarian, I would enjoy recommending. But, I can't keep on the library shelves a book that takes the death of pets so lightly."
negative,More effective than counting sheep!,"The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson (sp?) are good actors. It's the story that sucks. Maybe the story is true, maybe it's been embellished ... I wouldn't know because I'm no historian. But I do know that I could barely keep my eyes open. It was torture to watch it. I finally gave up after an hour."
negative,Not Comprehensive,"The fundamental failing of this book is that the methods of restoration described in the text require a significant degree of skill to master (French Polishing, Hammer Veneering with hide glue, cabinet-making skills, et al) thus making the text exceedingly schizophrenic. The book assumes that the reader is a neophyte, but anyone who has already mastered the rudimentary skills needed to complete one of the projects given in the text would have no need to purchase the book, as they would now be self-reliant. For someone just starting out, a better learning resource is Brian Hingley's ""Ultimate Guide to Furniture Repair and Refinishing"" which gives step-by-step accounts of the process. Furthermore, the photographs of the completed projects are so poorly photographed (hidden in shadows, or a close-up shot) that one cannot ascertain if the restoration has been a success."
negative,cheap junk,this is the biggest peice of crap.the spring on the unit is made of none spring metal and lost tention right away. buy another arrow rest.allen company sells toy quality stuff not made to stand up to any stress of use.
negative,cheap cheap cheap..........,cheap cheap cheap..........VERY thin would never buy again...Men's Powder Blue Dress Shirt w/ Convertible Cuffs sz 17 1/2 34/35....can't recommend!~
negative,file cart,The size is perfect. The product itself is unstable and wobbly. The base clips fall off. This is not a mobile cabinet that I will use long term due to the instability.
negative,Ecstasy can Kill You,The only reason I have this Avant album was because my sister bought it ( without my explicit authorization and consent....from now on all her music purchases go through me so maybe she will stop buying horrible albums) and I burnt it. Thank goodness I didn't waste my money on this...this...on this. It was so much garbage...the only good song ( in my opinion) was the one he dropped for the single and I don't even know the name of it. He can sing but that's about all. That doesn't guarantee a good album. I've listened to the cd probably twice when it came out and has been collecting major dust in my extensive myriad of albums. If I was you I would pass the album going 200 miles per hour without even bothering to look in the rearview mirror.
negative,"Pretty voice, not much else","Inessa Galante has a lovely voice. Unfortunately, her delivery leaves much to be desired. In other words, while most of these songs are nice, and Galante sounds okay singing them, you can find always find better versions. Particularly the Jewel Song, Caro nome, and Sempre libera are entirely unsuited to Galante's heavy voice."
positive,Pretty Decent but typical,"the fight scenes are great but we've seen the moves before. the acting is satisfactory but the girl who play (i think the character is Karen) her acting was really good. Overall I give the movie a B, just because I like action flicks. . ."
negative,Disgusting!,Me and my girlfriend wanted and needed to lose weight. We decided that she would take ALLI and I would just eat a low fat diet and exercize with her as ALLI reccommends.The results: After 1 month I had lost 6 pounds and she had lost 4 pounds. We both did the exact same thing besides she took ALLI for a month and I didn't.The kicker: She was miserable and was finshed with ALLI after the end of the month. This because of the continuous gas and oily discharge that happened if she ate the slightest bit of fat. It was absolutely discusting to think that people would endure these side effect for that little bit of weight loss.Not to mention I won! How'd I do it? I exercized 3 times a week by walking and riding a bike and I ate sweets only on Saturday. I cut the starches & sugars and cooked with olive oil plus ate wheat bread for sandwiches.Summary: This pill isn't worth it! You're making ALLI rich while they laught at your bathroom difficulties. It's like a sick joke!
positive,Sark is amazing...,"I picked up this book a few years ago when I was going through my divorce. It was one of the lowest points in my life. When I started to read this book, it empowered me to be who I really am...not what others think I should be. I still have the book in my nightstand and pick it up and read some of it when I'm not feeling great about myself. I think every woman should read Sark....especially this book. Every woman should feel succulent!"
positive,"good memories, good movie!","I grew up watching The Buttercream Gang. My siblings and I watched the VHS tape about a hundred thousand times. So naturally, when I found it here on DVD I was ecstatic. Great quality. Can't believe it is on DVD. Not only do I recommend this seller, but if you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out. Young or old, it reminds us that we can all use a little cheesy, heartwarming storyline in our worldly, overstimulated lives!"
positive,"The kid's love it, storage is poor.","Well, I just had to have this kitchen. And overall, it is fun and Step2 definitely makes good products. I've had this for over a year. My complaint is lack of storage. The storage areas (for foods and ""pots/pans/cups"") are extremely small. All of the cabinets (including the oven/microwave) combined wouldn't hold the amount of items that 1 small cabinet in one those wooden kitchen sets would hold. So overall it's nice and sturdy (both of my kids have climbed all over it - without permission mind you) and it's held up well. But if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't b/c it's so big without the storage (and we don't have a playroom)."
negative,"An unintresting,dull look on panoima","Enemy of the State is boring, and has an uninresting story and dialoge. Some good acting by Regina King. But the plots were over to long and there was no fun just watching the film, and plus the thrills were worthless, it was like going to a store and on to home. Thats what this movie shows. And I have to admit it there was some good things I liked, like when Will Smith runs off trying to get to his home to tell his wife that someone is after him,that was a good scene. But overall the movie isn't worth seeing, but that's my opinion. C- **"
positive,Cool indie horror flick,"I prefer my horror flicks indie style. Get too big budget on one of these and it starts to feel convoluted. Anyway, I dug this. I've got a huge horror collection and I will rewatch this with my buds."
negative,The Greatest Television Series EVER: CENSORED!,"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin was simply the most inspired, profound, brilliantly written, and painfully truthful series ever to find its way onto television. This was something rare...TV for smart people! Chaucer would have loved this, and Shakespeare would have stolen plots from it.I happened to have been in London and saw Leonard Rossiter on stage in Loot a few nights before he died (during a performance.) He was a great actor, and in PERRIN was supported by a brilliant cast. The humor cut to the core of society's hypocrisy unlike any other show, before, or since, and was a weekly beacon of hope for the jaded cynics whose senses of values were daily buffeted by this maddening world.So what does the modern day Inquisition do? It's been PC sanitized for our protection.END CENSORSHIP! DON'T BUY THIS. DEMAND the original in its full anti-social glory."
positive,Book review,"Fast service from book store. So thank you for that!However, the book itself was a let down. It was reviewed favorably by publisher, but i thought the book - a collection of essays about my favorite subject (botany)- was a bit boring. It could have been a show stopper of essays written in vivid prose, but instead it just left me flat and uninspired."
positive,Practical Techniques for Change,"I expected much more from this book , however there were some very practical techniques that were useful for living successfully."
positive,Great maker for the price,"This is a great coffee maker for someone looking to spend under $100. I thoroughly researched coffee makers in this price range and settled on this one despite the negative reviews.1. This maker is easy to use and easy to clean.2. The lid on the thermos is hard to twist if you tighten it too much. Simple solution: don't tighten it that much.3. The carafe is excellent and keeps coffee piping hot for two hours; it is still hot enough to drink without microwaving four hours later.4. The design ensures that the coffee never sees the light of day as it is brewing, so your coffee remains hot.5. I'm not sure what temperature this brews at, but it seems to be hotter than other machines I've tried in the price range.In all, this is a good coffee maker for the price."
positive,Very good listen,"I listened to the audible version and enjoyed it very much. The accent of the performer lent an air of authenticity to the book that I enjoyed. Liked hearing about the mans life from his own point of view. Will follow it with a less biased version at some point to see how they compare, but this was very well written and well performed."
positive,Ricky Carmichael championship Motocross,"I gave this game a four because it does not allow the user to create their own tracks and it does not have real bikes. For instance, they should have Yamaha, Honda and Suzuki, but they have Hamaha or something like that. I think the game play is GREAT! I find myself playing this game over and over again. Allowing users to create tracks would add to the longevity of the game. In my opinion, this game has the best game play of all the motocross or supercross games out there. If you rent this game, you will end up buying it."
positive,Once in a lifetime,"Where to start. I was fortunate enough to be able to actually be at this Wrestlemania. Have to say it was Excellent! One of the best Wrestlemania's ever. My two favorative matches were Cena v Rock and Triple H v Undertaker (definitely the best match of the night). Definitely a ""once in a lifetime"" experience. The extra's are cool too. Also includes the Hall of fame induction ceremony in it's entirety. Definitely worth buying."
positive,A First Class Shaving Gel,I find this gel to be superior to the foamy Gillette product. It easily worked into a good uniform foam and I find no reason for a change to another product.
positive,Oliver Review,Rozz Williams make a great project in the area industrial noise.A brilliant work!Listen this album!I think this is magnificent!
positive,I'm happy with my paper,"The paper arrived as described, was a great color. Much cheaper (about 30% less even with shipping) than the smaller reams available at the local Office Depot."
positive,"Great design, discrete, great for Dad!","Love this diaper bag. All the essentials for a quick trip anywhere. I throw it in my hiking back and take my little one hiking with me, good for a half day trip. Throw it in the truck anytime she is around. Its black, discrete, and extremely functional. Love the changing pad.... comes in very handy. Can't say enough about this."
positive,Ditto--Great Phone,"Kudos for this phone!The Micro SD included fills up pretty quickly, where about tweleve songs filled it up. The micro SD comes with an SD adapter and I bought an SD/USB adapter at CompUSA for about $10.00 and they work great, just like any another expandable memory stick. Songs loaded on the Micro SD need to be placed in the Media folder or the phone won't recognize them.Battery is good considering what the phone does. I purchased a back-up battery for $30.00 plus S+Tax but the phone didn't recognize it and wouldn't work. So I returned it and bought an original battery for about $35.00 plus, and it works great! Better than the one that came with the phone, although they both work fine.The phone functions work fine, pretty standard stuff."
negative,meh Four Paws used to be higher quality,"I wanted to love this brush - I have an old Four Paws brush that ""somehow"" ended up with the handle chewed off. the old brush was my favorite for my tender skinned aussie - and I had it for about 8 years.this new brush is plastic handled instead of wood - which is evident from the picture.The big problem with the new style is the little black safety ends are breaking off the pins after about 2 days of use. this leaves little sharp pins - making my pups & me unhappy."
positive,Students and Business should read,"I enjoyed reading this book. I think the author raised some good points and the book itself could help a small business owner understand how the business landscape is evolving. The author uses some case examples on how other businesses have implemented a co-creation process. These examples are now a bit outdated however, they are current enough to reinforce his point. At the end of the day the author's point was communicated well and easy to understand. If you are looking for a quick read that can potentially increase your understanding of how business is conducted then I would recommend you give this book a shot."
positive,C.K is Hilarious,"Louis is such a great stand-up comedian who has excelled since the early days of his career. I have a young daughter myself, and I am experiencing the same situations in my life. In addition to the use of word ""faggot"", the health problems, ...etc.He keeps me in-check and locked in.A great item to own & watch with friends!"
negative,You Are Not Needed Now,"There are some great names singing great versions of great songs here, but when all is said and done I heartily recommend you get your fingers dirty with the real thing. Let LIVE AT THE OLD QUARTER or REARVIEW MIRROR be your introduction. This guy's like a cross between Hank Williams & early Leonard Cohen. Needless to say, he was not afraid of the dark.Like the cheesy cover of POET, this star studded tribute (whose heart is in the right place) is just a white-washing of the crooked, meandering fence Townes set up between Nashville and what has come to be known as ""Alternative Country"". In short, the originals kick the guts out of any the cover here.It certainly isn't a bad record, but who needs a new car when the old jalopy runs just fine."
positive,Great Cast,"This was another good movie by Christopher Guest. I love this cast, especially Catherine O'Hara 's character. Recommended, especially if you enjoy Guest's other movies 'Best in Show' and 'A Mighty Wind'."
negative,How Children Fail,Our opinion about John Holt's book is very two sided because he talked mostly about what he observed in his own way about students. John Holt was very pointless on many occasions about what he was writing about in How Children Fail. Why couldn't he write something positive about children on why they fail? Some children have different learning styles and that's why some fail. The book in our opinion needed to have a different topic and have some other meanings to it because he never talked about what type of things that children can do to make them stop failing and what type of teachings that they can get.
negative,Not so pro lens,"I am not impressed with this lens. The 100-400 is just as sharp as the cheaper Canon 75-300 lens. The other thing that bugs me is when using the 1.4x with the 100-400 is...you have no auto focus. Yet, if I put a cheap close up tube on the 100-400 I have auto focus. Go figure. For the money that one pays for this lens and 1.4x you should get auto focus and a shaper image. I've used Canon for years starting with the Canon FTb and F-1. The cameras and glass, in my opinion, were superior then. It makes me want to switch to Nikon or Pentex."
positive,Ooooh pretty,"I love this ring, its stones are super sparkly and the detailing on the side of the setting is exquisite."
negative,Not the same as stores,"I have bought multiple versions (i.e. color) of these jeans over the past six months or so at different stores. When I got the pair of jeans that I ordered from Amazon, I found that they fit tighter than any that I bought in the stores - mainly in the crotch area. I could not really tell that much of a difference between the fabric. I returned them to Amazon and just bought a pair at Dillards."
positive,Love this movie,"It's a good movie, that's why I bought it. I only give it 4 stars because it had a couple scratches. It plays fine though"
negative,Pass on this one...,"I compared many items online looking for a portable FM tuner which I have come to rely on with my Nokia phone while dog walking every day. I bought this to take the place of my new phone without an FM tuner. Very disappointed in the sound, size, ability to lock in stations, nothing comes in on TV tuner at all, and the buttons to move to favorite stations are goofy. If this was a $25 item I would say it is worth it but not at this price. After I bought it, I was at Target and saw many options that were actually MP3 Players with FM tuners that would have worked as well for less money even though I don't own any music to download! Live & Learn. No complaints about the vendor that sold it to me though, they had the best price out there."
negative,Gone in under ten minutes,"While my dog enjoyed this chew very much, he devoured the whole thing in under ten minutes. 40 pound Australian Shepherd that I would not describe as a particularly aggressive chewer, finished the 'average' says much faster than I expected. I thought the material would be harder and more difficult for them to break off pieces. It's probably great for small dogs, but too much money for something I wanted to last for much longer."
positive,kindle is great for rec'g books instantly.,the more i use kindle the better it gets and the more i increase my knowledge of its splendid offerings.
positive,Awesome Tires. You have my recomendation,"Great all around tire. Good for MX, cross country, and the more intense stuff. Not to mention they look great too! A+ in my book!"
negative,For collectors only,"Baseball Games is a very basic effort: the captions give minimal information, the pictures are just satisfactory, and there's no narrative to put the games in any context. And the price is outlandish !"
positive,Great fantasy and very entertaining,everyone that reads this book will instantly become attached and will never be able to put this book down!
negative,An Embarassing Report,"This book explains why it took so long to catch the sniper from the last paragraph on page 221 through page 223. Incompetence. The rest is a lot of whining by Moose. On page 226 he complains about how ""inconvenient"" it is to change out of uniform before going home although that is not required. Later he admits he was stopped for speeding and that his wife has been stopped multiple times! Great behavior for a chief of police. He is ""victimized"" by racial profiling. Hey so is every black person in this country. On page 288 he says Bush made a congratulatory phone call on the capture of the snipers. Moose whines that Bush should have made a personal visit. He left his job so he could write this book. Maybe that's a good thing. I must get the Horwitz book now to read the real story."
positive,Universal lid - dimensions,"Reasonably good quality stainless lid. For those needing dimensions, they are:Overall outside diameter: 12 3/8""Diameter inside rolled edge: 12 1/8""Diameter across dome: 7 3/4""Height of dome: 1 1/2""So, the largest pan this lid will work well on is, say, 12 1/16"". Beyond that, the rolled edge will prevent a stable fit."
negative,starts out slow,"Could not keep my interest. Starts out slow, boring,to much discription not enough story. I read fall on your knees and that was a good book."
positive,Hey Digimon!Hey Digimon!,"It was a pretty cool book, but I warn you-there are bloopers!Especially if you watch the show, you'll notice everything wrong in this book.There is A-LOT of things they messed up on.Well any how, this book gives info on Digimon you never knew. A great book for the Digimon fans."
positive,Tepid but has potential....,"The first few episodes have been a bit ""tepid"" but based on the excellent 1st and 2nd seasons and the great potential set up by those seasons and the great characters, I, with hope, grant it 4 stars. The reality has yet to be determined!"
positive,My baby grandaughter's favorite Xmas toy !,"My 9 mos. old grandaughter just had her 1st Christmas ! She rec'd more-than-enough toys from family & friends BUT she loves the Tolo toys the best. This one seems sturdily-made and is 'fun' even for the grown-ups ------ that is, if you can get the baby to 'share' !"
negative,Bad Experience,"I bought the H500 headset and it was TERRIBLE! It had so much static you could not carry on a conversation! When I took it back to the cell phone store I was informed by the salesperson that they had sent back all of their H500's because of the static and unsatisfied customers. I purchased an H700 and LOVE IT! There is no camparison! Don't waste your money on the H500, mine went in the trash!"
positive,Exceptional educational game/toy,"I purchased Leapster for my grandson for a dual purpose - educational and game. It makes him think he has a Gameboy but he understands the difference. He has gone through one set of batteries since Christmas day (2 1/2 days of use). I'm looking for another source of power to cut back on the batteries. He is totally mesmerized with this toy. He is ADHD and needs to have things moving, changing and interesting to keep his attention, boy does it ever. Thanks Leapfrog for another great idea. More games and accessories would be great also."
positive,Do you like dresses? This is the book for you!,"The book I read was The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes. It was about a girl named Wanda who was shy and got teased. Diversity means Difference in language, dress, food, where parents and grandparent were born, and race, religion, are not only allowed but accepted as important. Diversity happened when Wanda moved here. She had a different language, she dressed different and she had no money. I liked this book because it is about how people don't like to be teased."
negative,Waiting for Extended Editions,"No way I am letting the studios double dip again. I already did it once for the DVD versions, but not again. It's a real shame because so many people have been waiting for this Trilogy on BluRay. I really hope they reconsider and release the EE at the same time, or even better yet add it to these disks and release it bundled together. This theatrical only release and a possible 2 year wait for the Extended versions is a monumental disappointment."
positive,Frank Sinatra is awesome,"I used to be into rap & heavy metal, but after listening to Sinatra, it seems to me that he is the very essence of pure, beautiful music. This album was my first, and it's great to start out listening to Sinatra with. But I plan to purchase all of his albums sooner or later; this is one artist that will be here forever. I STRONGLY suggest that you purchase this album; I promise you will enjoy it."
positive,FINE GUIDE TO WRITING,"This is ""A Guide to Writing with Readings,"" and does a good job in preparing a student for college writing (EN 101). It is written in a easy method of understanding, and moves the student right along at a reasonable pace.The text gives a step-by-step of writing a sentence, a paragraph and finally an essay. The lessons are interesting and the readings right on target. The index and table of contents are excellent and makes it easy for the student to find what he/she needs. I teach English at our lcoal community college and have found the text effective - the students seem to appreciate the flow of lessons. Good job!"
positive,GPS steady,Finally a product that will keep my GPS on the dash. Great idea - great product - works exactly like I wanted.
positive,Fun but noisy,"I bought this mower for my grandson who is 2. He played with it right away, running through the house ""mowing"". It is pretty noisy with the popping action which can get annoying for adults but kids love it. My 3 yr. old grandaughter tried to take the mower away from my grandson as he played. Seems to be really durable."
negative,My Review,"I enjoyed reading this book because, Sam, the main character, likes to try new, non-city related, foods, homes, and clothing. Every detail in the story is fully described. When you read the book, you can clearly picture each setting, and you feel like you are there. I would definately recommend this book to a friend! I'm sorry if you don't like my score.~Tiger D. - age 10"
positive,This book is awesome!,"I read this book and this is definitely my favorite of all the books I have read. This book is very, very, suspenseful and a little spooky. This was the first Sherlock Holmes book I have read and it got me hooked on Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't put this book down because it was so suspenseful and it was very entertaining. I would recommend this book to anyone."
negative,Left Wing Propoganda,This book isn't so much history with a political bias as it is political propoganda with a loose basis in history.
negative,Disgusting,"this product tasted very bad in my opinion. it didn't matter what you mixed it with or how you mixed it, it still tasted bad. Egg whites as you know foam up a lot when shaken or stired, so it was really hard to try to use this as a protein shake. The reconstitued egg whites from the powder tasted like leather or rubber."
negative,Funk Brothers CD,I was disappointed on this one. Not enough of their great hits on here. Loved the video/movie of these amazing musicians - wish the CD did them justice!
positive,Hdmi cables for a great price and got delivered really fast!!,Product came as advertised and fairly quickly. Satisfied with the purchase and would recommend seller!
negative,Not what they promised us.,"Even though I love *Nsync to death, this album did not come out the way I thought. I was hoping for more songs like Bye,Bye, Bye and This I Promise You. Instead we are stuck with 13 songs that all sound alike and not too many love songs. Pop, the first single, is a great song,but all the other songs follow in the same funky style beat. Pop made me believe they were stonger musically. When I listened to the other songs, it sounded as if they were whining about there lives and wern't looking for a change."
negative,Confusing & loaded with errors,I am taking an Assembly class and I find this book frustrating at times due to lack of explanations and details in its steps. I have always had to Google to help with the material. This books contains a lot of errors which don't help either.
negative,just a yank trying to pass off as an aussie,"I ordered this book because I wanted to understand Australian dialect better. The book is very short, only 16 pages, but it contains lots of useful information. It includes phonics and speaking exercises which I found helpful. However the tape was horrible! I assumed that the tape would be done by an actual Australian; but how wrong I was! I started listening to it, and I've heard enough aussie's speak, to begin to wonder if the tape's speaker was really Australian. I soon found out however, when the speaker smoothly changed to his normal voice; east coast american! That was enough for me to start laughing insanely and finally to toss the tape into a pile of other cassette rejects, including my personal favorite; How to Speak with a Southern Accent by Zehni lai Quien!! If you really want to understand aussie dialect, listen to real aussies. But if you want a good laugh, order this!"
positive,"""Tell me why can't it be true...""","""I don't want to be shyCan't stand it anymoreI just want to say `Hi'To the one I loveCherry blossom girl""Sweet innocence and a sense of shyness permeate this beautiful song about romantic dreams and tentative longings. The lyrics and creative playfulness are enhanced by an evocative voice flowing like a river trying to reach the sea.There are four versions to enjoy, although the first is my personal favorite. The last version is purely instrumental and emphasizes the haunting elements of flute. Hope Sandoval's version is breathy and dreamy with more variety in the lyrics.The mix version doesn't seem to exemplify the innocence I love in the song and seems to muddy up the image of the sweet dreamy mood with much more intense and sensual beats.""I'll never love againCan I say that to youWill you run awayIf I try to be trueCherry blossom girl""~The Rebecca Review"
negative,Off Track,"Brown wqas simply not up to par! I found it a struggle to get through the book when usally I can't put them down. It was obviosly a gross mistake as far as jacket blurb goes. Who let this get by? I hope Rite Mae Brown can get back on track. If not, I will loose one of my favorite authors!"
positive,One of the best Christmas movies ever,"No really! If you haven't seen this movie, you have missed one of the best Christmas movies of all time. Watch it now!!"
negative,Good but way overpriced,"Why I like them:These are straightforward vocab books. I create other activities to go with them, but I like the exercises.Why I'm not buying them now:Way overpriced!! Who wants to pay almost $20 for what is really a workbook? And why would I pay $15 including shipping for a **used** workbook that has already been used??"
negative,Disappointing,Too bad this book promises so much and delivers so little. Not much in the way of new ideas or originality. A little too much selling on the part of the author.
negative,Kindle edition is not the book pictured,"I just purchased the book a few minutes ago and have not read it yet, i will read it of that there is no doubt.But what i noticed after opening it is the Kindle version is not the book that is pictured. The (Plus) bits are not included, aparently only the paperback version has these. Loking at the table of contents for the paperback you will see there is a chapter at the very end about the ""Authors further indites"". This chapter is not present in the Kindle version. Also the cover of the Kindle version is different, obviously since it is not the current release of the book.Very disapointed in Amazon for this false advertising."
negative,Horrible Packages,"I ordered two bags of Haribo Gummi Bear and the package arrived on time. However, once I opened the box I realized the original bags were opened and the gummy bears were hardened. I was so upset about this order."
negative,Feminem Sucks,"I cannot believe how trash like this could possibly be popular. I mean seriously, all this guy does is drones on by swearing and making seriously offensive lyrics. Another thing is, is how he dumbs down the population by saying that this is music! I swear, some of the most stupid people I have ever met have feminem fans. How do I know, well lets just say he disses his OWN fans and yet he still sells million of albums. He also showed no support for the victims of 9/11. When other bands and artists are doing charities for them, feminem showed no sypamthy for them at all. I could go on and on about how this guy sucks but I'll let this great site do the rest www.Feminem.com. Last word of advice: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP THAT IS FEMINEM!"
positive,It ain't easy...........,"......being the child of a legend, but Bebel Gilberto manages just fine. The daughter of Latin Jazz superstar Joao Gilberto has done quite well making her own fame. A parent's name can, sometimes, be a burden...though, sometimes, it can also provide a key to open the door. Still, once the door is open, the child has to rely on their own talent, not the parent's. Happily, Bebel has all the talent one could ever want.This is a great, thoroughly enjoyable, upbeat album. No point in discussing individual tracks; you'll like them all. Beautiful girl, great music, you'll get hooked in a hurry. Promise.By the way, no connection with Latin legend Astrud Gilberto; she's just Bebel's Dad's ex-wife."
positive,POISON'S Lost CD finds way to the public!,"Poison returns to the top with a 1995 recordered, delayed and cancelled CD. This is Poison sounding as good as ever with big chorussy songs, lots of attitude and great lyrics. Bret, Bobby, Rikki and Blues has put out a great set of tunes!"
negative,Bait and Switch,"I heard Nellie on NPR's, ""Morning Edition"", with Bob Edwards. She was playing a piano and singing. I was so excited by what I heard, it was definitely a 5 star performance. I was planning to buy this album. Then I read one of the Amazon reviews which alerted me to the fact that it wasn't just Nellie and a piano. As I listened to the samples of the same songs that I heard on NPR, I became disappointed. The reviewer was right, a great premier album was ruined by drum machines, synthesizers and noise. Nellie, next time just you, a piano and your imagination. Oh, an acoustic bass and drums would be just fine too."
positive,Fragile But Beautiful!!,"I love J Renee shoes and bought both the silver and the pastel versions of this shoe. Both right shoes pulled out where the thong attaches to the sole after just a few wearings. I took them to a local cobbler and paid $8.00 each to have them repaired. I get lots and lots of compliments on these shoes and love wearing them as they are very pretty and comfortable. I have many pairs of J Renee shoes and have never had a pair break until purchasing this particular style, however, I would buy the black patent ones if they weren't sold out everywhere, even knowing they would probably pull out and have to be repaired as well."
positive,I laughed and was ministered to throughout the cd!!!!!,"This Cd regardless of any review that speaks negative it is in my opinion a step up from other music out there that does not glorify Jesus. Yes there r 1 or 2 songs that I was not really feeling but all in all this cd made me crack up with Fivetweezy, Rock With It, Plain White Rapper and For The Ladies. Plus several others that really ministered to me.You can hear longer snippets of his songs by going to his webpage that is kj52 . com. Wonderful for youth fans that need godly fresh hip hop. If you love hip hop and Christ I don't think that you will be disappointed with this Cd. Truly for all ages. A must get!!"
positive,"Great speaker, good value, but beware of impedance issue!","I bought this speaker to replace my $270 JL speaker that blew out after five years of use. This speaker kicks just as hard and sounds just as good as the JL. I can absolutely tell no difference. I should have bought this one first!My only gripe is the impedance. When I bought it, it was advertised as simply a ""4 ohm speaker."" What I actually received was a speaker with two 4-ohm voice coils. That means I can either run them in parallel and get 2 ohms, or series and get 8 ohms. What I wanted was 4 ohms, which is not possible with this speaker.Fortunately, my amp can handle a 2-ohm load, BUT my amp can put out 600 watts at 2 ohms, and this speaker can only handle 400. So I just have to be careful not to turn the gain up too high, or I'll blow out the speaker. I wanted a 4-ohm speaker because my amp puts out 400 watts @ 4 ohms, exactly what this speaker can handle. Oh well.Just putting the warning out there for you."
negative,trouble going to opposite side of house,I purchased this wireless router so I can use my laptop downstairs and the opposite side of the house from the router.It doesn't have any stronger of a signal than the cheap wireless router I was using. So for going the distance it isn't very good. Seems it goes up to 30 or so feet then looses signal.
positive,This GPS is full featured at an affordable price,"Bought this GPS as a gift, and in just 5 minutes of setup, we had already mounted it to a mountain bike and were off in search of GeoCache's. With the WAAS and its thousandth of a minute accuracy, we were able to pinpoint the location perfectly.I really liked its durable feel as well as the Indigloesque backlighting."
positive,Great Comedy Writing Tips,Buy it!! All Gene Perret's Books are right on. Comedy is an art that must be studiedlike all arts. Gene is very clear on this. Do it as much as possible but one very important thing HAVE FUN!
negative,Vermonter,Junk. Instructions very poor and could not install!!! Tried for an hour to install. There is no way to install on any of my doors!
positive,Good nutrition info,Lots of vitamin/mineral info. Almost too much but veryInformative. Many receipe ideas. Some I would modify forHealthier ingredients but gives a good starting point.Some receipes not very readable via kindle
positive,Have to finish this book!,After reading about one third of this book I began to wonder why I kept reading. Then all at once it grabbed me and I couldn't stop.
negative,The Worst Ever,Don't be fooled by the price. This pump is horrible. It lost a great deal of suction. It is heavy and loud. Milk flows through the tubing that milk should not even touch. All around waste of money. If you want a good pump get a Lanisoh. I have had no issues with it and can pump for 15-20 min and fill up my bottles and is much more quieter.
positive,Decent home for guinea pigs,"Decent home for guinea pigs...one pet, two at most...water bottle included not top grade--I replaced it immediately with quality bottle...check freshness of food included...Amazon's price $20 to $40 less than at pet stores for same product..."
negative,GREAT SHOW - HORRIBLE MARKETING,I love this show. It is clever and very adult - a great addition to the DC family.BUT! I am NOT going to pay $34 total for all three sets just to have Season One!!!!!Seriously people?? Hold out and wait for better packaging and don't buy into this extortion.
positive,A great read,"This was a really fun read. What I loved was how, on their first meeting, the hero thinks the heroine has snubbed him. From then on, she's got an uphill battle to win his heart. This author is great with character, has a sense of humor and the romance is steamy. I highly recommend it."
negative,coolaroo dog bed,"These beds will not hold up to English bulldogs. As far as the dogs are concerned they like them. After about three months they had chewed holes in them and had to be replaced. Kuranda beds however will withstand all my dogs,and have for years no holes yet. So if you don't plan on replacing your dog beds don't buy these."
positive,Super Reliable,Have had this straightening iron for 5 years and is still the best product I've had. Well worth the money.
negative,terrible!,"I picked this up at the store. I used it and it was terrible! My son is 5 months old (he is a big boy! More like a 7 month...) and just like Reviewer ""Spring Bird Momat40"" I couldn't get him out!!!! He was stuck!!!! His legs were so red from me trying to get him out of it.There most be something better!"
negative,Not useful,You'd have to be a very accomplished 2D animator to make use of this book. The notion of doing everything in hand drawn 2D first is interesting but probably not an efficient detour for most people who are trying to become acquainted with 3D animation.
negative,Green Beret CD,DVD sent to me is defective. Stops mid way through movie. No information on how to return or exchange movie. Very Dissappointing!
positive,Good times,"Looking for a keepsake from the 2003 Warped tour besides that Rancid t-shirt you bought? Look no further in the form of the official 2003 DVD, with performances from Glassjaw, Andrew W.K, Dropkick Murphy's, the Used, Avenged Sevenfold and Poison the Well. This well put together DVD shows what daily life on the Warped tour is like, showcases the artists involved and features a wide spectrum of music that stretches across the punk and hardcore worlds. Where else are you going to find a live version of Andrew W.K's `We Want Fun'? That alone is worth the price of admission."
positive,Excellent When Used with other AP Reviews,"Although this book lacked depth of information when reviewing history, the tips on the multiple choice section and how to write the essays was fabulous. The practice tests were very helpful to me because I used this book to skim through the material, to look at the terms and to make sure I knew what those terms were (even though they were not defined). The tests will help you know how to deal with the real test. I used this review book with the one by REA and the Princeton Review, and found it very helpful."
negative,Sometimes a Critic,"I heard this book & author discussed on Garage Logic: Rave reviews. It's about St.Paul, so it must be interesting at least. Wrong!The book is trash and that's where I threw it.Don't waste your money or time on this book.Wish I could have given it zero stars."
positive,"A dark, epic masterpiece!","By far E Nomine's best work! The music is pulse pouding yet maintains an epic feel at the same time.This is a great album that no one should miss. And Mitternacht (Track 2) is the most dark and exciting song I have ever heard.Must buy, you will not be disapointed!"
negative,yuk,"... sorry, this one really was not worthy of McCarthy. I was on page 100 before the book got interesting. Before that it was all just page after page of sex. Pick up a porn novel. I trudged through it wondering if this was McCarthy's first try at writing (?) I was kind, though, and gave another chance with ""Heiress for Hire"". That is a winner through and through. Skip this one and read that book."
positive,You may feel like you'll need a shower after this book.,"This book is full of objectionable and odious characters. And Barnard does an excellent job in his characterizations of the terrible Hodsden family. The victim (mother) of this family is so truly awful, and she rules over her family with an iron fist. The family lives cheaply and vulgarly, and none of them are accepted in their village. There's not much mystery here, but the reading is pure pleasure. We are forced to keep reading, and as we read we shudder and are grateful that maybe our lives aren't as tawdry as this. This is a wonderful ""in your face"" satire. Even the policeman in charge of the case is an unlikeable stuffed shirt. Barnard is a real master at characterization, and this book is just too much fun."
negative,Lousy as a PDF reader,"Lousy as a PDF reader because there is no scroll / slider button. What it does is cut the PDF file at random into chunks of page (according to the zoom setting used). Thus, zoom too small and you cannot read, too big and the text gets chopped in the middle of a line. My reading interest is Gutenberg / Googlebooks / National Library scans of out of copyright old books, not buying new books from Amazon. The text ones work OK, but there is not enough memory available to store a ""library"" like advertised. Mine is the ""Pocket"" version. I guess the whole page one would solve the viewing problems because it is A4 size, but I could probably get better value out of a ""Comic Reader"" type machine for PDF use."
negative,Inexpensive but unusable for adults,"This was the cheapest unit I could find and had good reviews for the most part. But it had 2 flaws that made me return it:1. The blue background display is so bright I had to face the clock away from me and cover it. It literally lit up the room. That of course rendered the clock useless to me. It's a clock radio designed to help you sleep better. Why they would make such a bright display for a bedroom device makes no sense to me. A black background with red letters makes so much more sense for the bedroom, and that technology has been around for decades, so it can't be about cost.2. The sound I cared about the most was the white noise. I assumed that noise would sound like a fan running or something smooth like that. This noise sounded like radio static and was far too harsh to try and sleep through."
positive,Helpful overview,"Swavely provides a simple, readable manual outlining the so-called wisdom approach to biblically based decision making. He offers a popular presentation of Garry Friesen's well-known work, Decision Making and the Will of God. The book is helpful for those who desire a simplified version of the wisdom approach and was beneficial as a resource for teaching a series on the topic in an Adult Bible Fellowship in our church."
positive,A good addition to the 30 minute seder,"I bought the 30 Minute Seder for my son, but also wanted the full Haggadah. My son looked through the book and was impressed with it. It will make a good companion to the simplified 30 Minute Seder."
positive,west point stevens full bed in a bag,good product. amazon again showed that no one can beat its price. i got it for $19.99 (which included S&H as i bought items worth of >$25).
negative,Pejorative towards Native Americans,"Since the book was written in 1939, I did expect some bias, but the way Allis refers to Abenakis so insultingly - for instance calling them ""John Redskin"" and ""of childlike imagination"" - just made it repulsive."
negative,"Well, it looked nice enough to buy...","...but sadly it didn't keep my interest. There were perhaps two stories out of the considerably sized book that even perked my interest. It may be because I didn't feel the stories got along well enough and the sex, well, left me flat more times than not. Erotica should sizzle, not be a limp noodle..."
positive,A hard to put down book,"The Testament is a great book, one you can't put down to long. You always have to find out what is going on next."
positive,"Beautiful, extravagant photography","I love Fall -- it's my favorite season, so I wanted to love this book. I wasn't disappointed! The photos are sumptuous and gorgeous; the recipes are yummy and inspire thoughts of running straight to the kitchen; and the information about the flowers was truly informative. If you love Fall, you'll love this book."
positive,fast ordering,"I've ordered a number of things on the internet, but its never gone this fast and easy before! All the steps were clear and easy to follow, and my order showed up quickly with no problems. I would order through these guys again, no hesitation!"
positive,Cult Classic!,"My boys LOVE this movie! They can probably quote the entire script in their sleep, voices and all!"
negative,Worst remaster of The Wall,"This seems to be the worst master of the wall to my ears. The best you can trust is Japan 1st press 50DP and 40DP or even MFSL 24 karat gold cd. For those you did not know there're way better sound quality of the wall before they were remastered again and again in 1994, 1997 and 2011. Hunting down the old master while you still can."
negative,Cost is excessive.,"Spend your money and ""weight"" on useful items that can extend your life not salve your delusions. The 15 cost is excessive."
positive,A good product,"All of our big box stores, and even the nurseries, only had the plastic connectors in stock so we went online to find something a little more durable. This does a good job at it's core function. When installed with Teflon tape (plumbers tape -- use it!) I didn't have any leaking at all.The valve handles can be a little tight to turn at first but seem to have loosened up the right amount over the last few months.The flanged collar that's intended to make it easier to connect, doesn't. The little nubs you're supposed to grip to turn the collar bend and are flimsy. If you have an application where you can't get in front of the spigot you might have a little more trouble putting this on, but it's not worth skipping it over.It's a good product and seems solid, I'm hoping for many years of use from it."
positive,A MUST have for NT/Win2k Network Admins,"Are you tired of Linux books written for former Unix admins? Or ones that constantly knock Microsoft products? (hey, we may not LOVE Microsoft but we usually have to LIVE with it's products). Are you an experienced NT/Win2k Admin? Then this book is a MUST have for your collection.Mark (along with Dan York) attacks Linux from an NT/Win2k point-of-view. As a NT/Win2k admin, I KNOW Win2k/NT file permissions...what makes Linux file permissions different? I KNOW how to set up a DNS/DHCP server in NT/Win2k...how do I set up a LINUX DHCP/DNS server? What makes a Linux web server different from IIS in NT/W2k? Mark/Dan do NOT waste your time re-explaining concepts we already know. Instead, they explain how to do the same stuff we've been doing for years in NT/Win2k in Linux.Even if you're not running any Linux in your present environment, you probably will some day.I highly recommend this book!!"
positive,Great alternate history for WWII buffs,"Gingrich/Forstchen write an amazing tale, a real page-turner for WWII buffs who have always wondered ""what if..."" the plot is plausable the action fast paced and Forstchen brings out the war as catalyst for mans advancement theme every bit as well as in his Lost Regiment series. Waiting for Forstchen to get back to this project is becoming painful. Aircorps buffs Gothas V. RATOCats... Nuff' said!! FORSTCHEN get to it man!!"
positive,Vaughan Williams with some steel in its spine,"However much some of the other complete Vaughan Williams symphony cycles have to recommend them, I don't know that the composer would have cottoned to their tendency to either sentimentalize the music or play up its lyrical elements at the expense of sterner stuff. The late Bryden Thomson did neither, and the result is one of the most clear-eyed, tough-minded, and convincing VW cycles available--comparable to Adrian Boult's almost-complete 1950s series. Paradoxically, that sharp focus actually heightens the sense of mystery in passages such as the opening movement of the Eighth Symphony and the enigmatic final pages of the Sixth. Only ""A Sea Symphony"" is less than a total success, and even there the expansive final movement impresses. This 5-CD set omits the shorter works that served as makeweights in the individual issues, but Chandos has reissued some of those recordings elsewhere."
negative,Don't recommend,"If you already know some basic Italian, perhaps this would be a helpful refresher. For a beginner, it's difficult to coordinate the tape with the text, they don't track one another directly. One would suspect that their respective preparers didn't talk much once they got started on this project. I regret buying this material."
positive,Great Jam,I loved finding this nice bag of Pectin for so reasonable. I have a Plum and Peach tree and this summer started getting tons of fruit which I shared with all my friends but decided to extend my crop by canning. I bought several little boxes of pectin in the store but they get pretty expensive. This nice large bag was enough to make 9 recipes of Jam and we love it. It tastes much better than store bought Jams. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who makes jams and I will definitely be buying it again next summer. Thank you!
negative,if I could bestow a negative star rating...,"the Gospel according to MeatLoaf poses the question:""on what day did God create the ""Loaf""...and couldn't he have rested on that day also."""
positive,Fantasy,"This movie is so interesting.It has such a great world.Most people I know wish they could live there,and I love it too. It's my all time favorite movie around.My child even did a report for school on the Luck Dragon.It was just a great movie & I would recommend this to everyone who loves fantasy, quests, out of this world creatures, and even don't mind a little sadness."
negative,Tries too hard to be good! It was boring and ridiculous!,"This movie has everything that I thought I would like! I am very diverse, I am Latino and I am gay (but straight looking and non stereotypical). So going into this movie, I was expecting something really good!! NO. It was just ridiculous. It tries too hard to be good and entertaining that it actually turns you off! This movie is more like some diverse party overnight with them filming themselves singing and talking about their problems. I can't believe people actually like this! Inclusion of diverse characters doesn't mean that it is automatically a hit. There has to be a character development that you can feel...it was just not in this movie!"
negative,A Feeble Try,"I expected these guys to put up a great show now that they are adults, but they were a shadow of their former selves. In any case I think only 1 or 2 of them are from the Original Musical Youth Band!"
negative,A Bad CD With Interesting Highlights!,"HERITAGE is really a bad CD with a few interesting highlights! Maurice White tried to incorporate musical styles & performers that were 'hot' at this time (M.C.Hammer, The Boys-W.T.F ??), and the group suffered with this project!! Talk about SERIOUS regrets huh?? Also, having Sly Stone as a guest (oh my!!).All in all, 'Heritage' does have it's bright moments such as 'I'm In Love', 'Anything You Want', and 'Daydreamin', but overall it had to grow on me!! The musical interludes are great (as usual), but they can't rescue the entire CD. Being a serious EWF fan, I decided to remaster 'Heritage' and include 2 BONUS TRACKS - 'Gotta Find Out' (B-Side of the single 'Heritage') & 'One World', a rare track from the 'Music Speaks Louder Than Words' benefit CD (1990, Epic). Note to EWF fans out there - If you'd like to remaster 'Heritage', consider adding these 2 Bonus Tracks. I doubt that Sony / Legacy will!Peace, SD(of 'Chakas World')"
negative,"Want to go ""Office Space"" on this thing","Liked it for the first 3 months. But after this, will never buy anything from Brother again.1. Cleans the ink head so often that the color cartridges will be empty in a matter of months even though I never print anything in color. I'm curious about where this ink goes. 3 replacements of 3 color cartridges = 9 cartridges of vanished ink. Probably back into the cartridge I suppose.2. Once a cartridge is empty, the printer is basically a brick until you replace that cartridge. Want to print a B&W; text document? Not gonna happen if your yellow is empty.3. Paper jams. Seems to happen mostly with photo paper.4. Print quality is annoying. There are 4 quality settings. The highest is so much ink that it's blurry. The lowest is unreadable. Option 3 still uses too much ink, Option 2 uses not enough for something you want to present to someone important.Other thought: I've been using generic ink in this for more than a year and haven't had any problems."
negative,Unreadable,"From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing.Overall, if you are looking for a good book on Rwandan genocide, do not buy this one. Its absolutely incomprehensible."
negative,Flashing Dots,"This Cable Worked Fine For a Few Days, And Then red green and blue dots started flashing constantly all over the screen during games. Nyko will not respond to my emails. Seriously, how do you screw up a Piece of metal wrapped in rubber?"
positive,Big but good,I actually love this knife. When it got here it was a lot bigger than I expected (evidently I don't actually know how big ten inches is) but it works great. It is amazing how much easier it is for me to cut and chop with a knife that actually holds and edge.
negative,Do not buy this fountain! Waste of money!,"I purchased the large Ergo Auto Pet Waterer a few weeks ago. It was great in the beginning, although my dogs did not drink from it very much. Then I went to clean it. It is a bear to clean. And lifting the 5 gallon water bottle in order to clean it, isn't pleasant either. When I cleaned it, there was a small piece next to the plastic filter that broke off. Plus, it leaks water in between the water tank and the bowl. I should call the manufacturer to ask for a new plastic piece, but it's not listed in the manual. My next fountain will not have an outlet. And as far as keeping it free from dog hair or food, that's bogus too. It does not keep the water free from hair or food. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste your money on this product!"
positive,Very different,"The book started out with a bang and didn't disappoint through out the book. One of those that makes you wonder and guess what I didn't figure out the end until the end that is a rearity. :) This book can easily be read in a day or two.Characters run from theories of Appocolips to Terristist, Can you guess which one it is?"
negative,Useless product,I am trying to stop a dog next door barking.It has no effect on the dog. (Great Dane)I have found the Dog Repeller to be useless!!
positive,turntable for trains,My grandson was really excited over his new toy. So much taht he found the package under the tree and opened it before Christmas!
positive,The Author is my Hero,"I just finished reading WHISPERS. I heard about the book through Lisa Haisha's monthly newsletter that I got turned on to from a friend forwarding it to me. I have never been out of the country and it is my dream. WHISPERS took me around the world and into the souls of children everywhere. It was incredible! I have to meet Lisa. I love what she is doing. This book can change lives. It has made me see the world with different glasses. And, the artwork is incredible, a definite bonus."
positive,This CD Kicks [butt],"It's ashame that Prodigy hasn't come out with anything that can equal this titanic, energized cd. I mean just listen to Breathe or Serial Thrilla, or even Disel Power! You are blown away by the raw base and hype cords. If you haven't heard Prodigy yet, you definitely want to pick up this cd! I am listening to it right now!"
positive,WORKS!,BUY IT ! this works and lets you get what you were looking for at an amazing price! thanks a lot ! the product works ! EASY intallatioN!
positive,Life of an 1880s Conservationist and Wilderness Traveler,"The author was 40 years older than Horace Kephart who wrote a more extensive book with a similar title. Both men wrote for Field and Stream, both were conservationists, both were instrumental in having major wilderness parks established. Sears wrote under the pen name of Nessmuk and it is to his mentor, Nessmuk, that Kephart dedicates his book. Sear's wilderness was the Adirondacks and he set off in light-weight canoes he had made to his specifications. A great read whose philosophy of wilderness and camping will never be out of date."
positive,Mmmmm Stargate.,"Netflix pissed us off by taking this series off of streaming, so we just bought it insteadof paying netflix for an upgraded package.We havn't gotten throught the whole thing yet but have been pleased withevery one of the dvd's so far.It was packaged very well and the collector box it comes in is just cardboard but it is pretty cool too."
negative,Disappointing,"Old Bones was a little disappointing. While the technical aspects were interesting, the plot was rather transparent and the overall scene was hackneyed. How many mysteries need to take place at a family gathering in an old country estate while key characters are getting bumped off or threatened? The characters were predictable and the coincidences were unbelievable. This was my first experience with Aaron Elkins, and it will probably be my last."
positive,great slippers,"I love Dearfoams slippers, they are the only ones I buy, for me its medical reasons as I need the open toe and heesel but I would recommend these slippers to anyone who loves comfort and easy care."
positive,i did this once,"It was a candy mold of moustaches - just as pictured. We were happy.(thought I already put a review of this in already, but I guess not.)"
positive,Very well designed,"This is a very well designed and manufactured little item. It does not drip in the slightest and is rather elegant. It's a tad larger than I would have liked, so pay attention to the size, but it's still very nice. It arrived in less than two days, so the kind of high shipping charge was worth it. It reminds me of a little bird!"
negative,Not airtight fit!,"Received these items and disappointed as they are not airtight as someone else eluded to with their review. This will not work ""instead of saran wrap."" The bag they are packaged in clearly states only a loose cover to specifically allow dough to rise while getting oxygen...and yes, I verified my mixer is one of the models listed in the item description for fit. If they weren't this inexpensive, I would have returned them."
positive,Fabulous,"The Xbox 360 console is a great machine and in it's current rendition has fixed many of the freezing / cooling issues it's had. The graphics and gameplay in the games of played so far are stunning, and the PS3 games, as of this review, don't look any better, and the 5.1 surround on this system is awesome through my digital surround reviever. Downside is still a lack of support for my favorite original Xbox titles, and the inability to easily transport your old xbox save games. Other than that I love it, I also use it as my Windows Media Center extender to watch my stored video's, pictures and TV from my Media Center PC through my Television downstairs."
negative,JUST DON'T TRY LUGGING THIS AROUND...,"I am a grownup bride with some experience in event planning. I bought the ""organizer"" as a tool for this most important event. After 3 weeks of struggling to make this planner work for me, I just threw it in the trash. What a waste! The book is huge, and cumbersome. Each section is filled with useless filler pages, and the sections aren't really as any normal bride would need them! I would hate to see any bride try to lug this thing into the stationer's or flip desperately through it when the photographer returns your call!A wedding planner should HELP, not hinder. Furthermore, the book contains advertisements, which seems unfair considering the price.Advice from a very disappointed customer: don't waste your precious time and money on this product."
negative,"Very, very bad.","This is one of the worst National Lampoon movies ever, other than Golf Punks. I bought the Canadian video version for $5.99 at Nobody Beats The Wiz, and I still felt ripped off. Don't pay so much for this movie. That said, this really isn't all that bad. There are some funny moments, like the talking rock that says ""Read the National Lampoon."" But the bad editing and confusing script is what gives this movie 2 stars."
negative,"I should have put more faith in the ""Short Stack"" review...","I regularly play limit holdem and I decided that I wanted to give no-limit a try so I thought I had better do a little research first. ...I was very disappointed by the book. I felt like I was reading a collection of random articles put together in a haphazard fashion. While yes, there are certainly a few nuggets of information to be found, the book is poorly organized, doesn't go in-depth enough, and veers off and covers some less well-known forms of poker, e.g., a chapter on ""Strip Deck Poker"".I think that I'm being somewhat charitable giving the book a rating of 2 stars,..The bottom line is that I can't recommend this book."
negative,Hey! I 've read this one before,"I haven't even purchased the book, yet when reading the overly detailed editorial review realized, ""Hey! I read this before."" Only the author was John Lanchester and the title was ""The Debt to Pleasure"". Only the Lanchester book was filled with recipes. (Something useful). I suppose I won't give the Schwartz rendition my time."
negative,Still waiting,This product still hasn't arrived - 6 weeks after it was ordered!!When it does I will share my view.
positive,Wonderful Book,"I've been looking for unusual storybook characters for stitching. Finally found them in this book! Paddington, Beatrix Potter, Madeline, Babar, Spot and others. It also has several ideas as to how to use the patterns. Most are smallish (bibs, edgings, etc) but there are some larger ones as well (samplers, puppets). I wish they would come out with a second volume!"
negative,Hollywood Grit,"Jeff Bridges was really a reason to watch this movie , but the rest ..... A child actor like in a Disney flick , was that necessary ? What a miscast for that kind of story . After a ride on a horse back through a river the actor appeared in bone dry clothing , was that supposed to be funny ? And here's the point , I had the impression that this movie was made to entertain everybody's taste . Like a creature , half chicken , half fish . After a smile , there's only left a laugh and a half ."
negative,"Good for a thirsty youth, but not much for me.","Ok, I am a metal head. Period. I listen to Pantera, Anthrax, Six Feet Under, OLD (capitalize on old here) Metallica, Slayer, etc. Then, someone said, ""HERE! LISTEN TO THIS!"" Well, it was Korn, and I was impressed by how they fused some hip-hop with thrash metal. BUT, they weren't my favorite. Now, Slipknot . . . well. It's a good fusion band, they've taken some styles and fused them. Now, when I listen to them, I don't really hear something I can be impressed with. I listen to Korn, Marilyn Manson, and other Darkwave style music for the emotion because it is methodical. I listen to OLD Metallica, Slayer, etc,; for the A)Technical compilations B) Speed of the rage. I see don't see true emotion in Slipknot, and I can't relate to them. And for complication . . . well, lacking in it is what they are. They have sped up rage, not much else. A lot of hot air, and not much depth."
positive,"Great little unit, but can be a little noisy","This unit has performed perfectly so far, I have owned it for about two years. The fan is a little bit noisy, but it it keeps the unit cool, and who cares about a little extra noise while you are driving?"
positive,"Dark, complex, clever.","Artwork has evolved and improved in this volume, as have the quality of the stories. The series grows at once darker, more meaningful, convoluted and complex, but also shows greater irony and humor at the same time. Clever writing; nice storytelling. Character development matures in this volume, and we are allowed some insight into the main characters of the series along with the people whose lives they become involved with. I was satisfied overall."
positive,Fun Car but Stickers Fall Off,"This was a perfect first birthday gift for my son from his Godmother! The only problem we have has with it is that the stickers peel off. I have no idea why!!! The car has never been outside our home, so it's not like it is in the weather. We have a large living room and it is a perfect inside toy for that. My brother assembled it for him after his party and had no problem putting it together. Watch out for the stickers, they will fall off."
negative,was disapointed in it,I purchased this printer about 3 months ago and it quit working for me. i tried to reinstalling it numerous times and it did not work. took it back to the store and bought the same one and it would not load for me. continude loading for 4 hrs. and i gave up. i wish i could have gotten it to work because i really like it when i got it...
positive,Very Interesting,"The story was very good. I actually had a hard time putting this down. So, it became a quick read. One thing I do have to say is this; being a man if the situation was reversed and Tom was a woman, I wouldn't have gave much thought to it. Hear about sexual harrasment all the time in the media. But reversing the situation made me actual look at the problem and realize what most women will go through in these problematic times."
positive,Prescient Miles,"This album's flawed no doubt and can get a bit over-indulgent but this is Jazz Funk for the new millennium. It was ahead of its time when it was first issued in 1972. It still is.No one anticipated musical trends better than Miles and this albums is proof. His underlying use of of Indian motifs, raw funk grooves and corruscating electronica prefigured everything from Shakti and Weather Report (post Mysterious Traveller)to Trilok Gurtu's eclectic blend and acid jazz.It may not be a landmark like Bitches Brew but this is essential to understand where Miles and Jazz was headed."
positive,An innovative book which opens new questions,This book explains the scientific approach to mind and body relations. A good approach to understanding of holly spirit and basis of religions. In islamic religion holographic universe is explained as ALLAH which is the only being with different appearances according to your limited perceptions. This book should have been followed by others to help reach the relations between science and religion
negative,Color,"Loved the size, texture and feel of the shawl. However, the color bled onto my beige jacket!! And, after washing it has not all come out!"
positive,Rico sax reeds,These are one of the best reeds that you can buy. They a great reed to use and do not take a lot of breaking in. I have used this make before and they have lived up to what it says on the packet. So for me there was no choice.
negative,A vain attempt.,"Like my title suggests this movie is a vain attempt to take credit from the first movie to sell sub-par music to a new generation of viewers. The first Heavy Metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line. The artistry was phenomanal in the first movie, much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in Heavy Metal 2000. The first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played, the second, well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie. To sum up...boring plot, no imagination, and a sound track to not die for. My advice? Use the DVD as a coaster and read a good Frank Herbert novel instead."
negative,sound quality very poor,"there are some great songs here - ""maintaining my cool"" may be my favorite Sonics number, but the sound quality of this dvd is inferior to my old record with the same content. A real disappointment."
positive,Battat Take Apart Airplane,"First gift opened by our three year old and we could have gone without any others! He absolutely loves it. The put together aspect becomes obvious after a couple of tries, the ""power screwdriver"" is the favorite part. To me this is like a 3D puzzle and it has kept our little guy busy for most of the past three days. I highly recommend this toy."
negative,WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY,"With Kenny G being the best selling saxophonist ever, you can't blame those folks who are falling all over for poor Mr. Helfgott's ""pianism"". As for the major music labels- who told you they're there to promote good music or good taste. They are corporations and set out to make money."
negative,no white horse,"i cant believe they would even try to come out with a hit package and not include their biggest international hit. best bet....... look for ""laidest greatest"" or the 2 albums put together on cd called ""Keep Smiling + Hole in the Sky"" ..... good luck on even finding them let alone how much the cost will be. I looked forever. I live in the usa. Finally I ordered both disc from Russia of all places, but the price was ok. The music is great!"
positive,"Cute rocking horse, good value, safe, doesn't rock that well","This horse bounces great, but doesn't rock back & forth very much.... it more scoots across the floor on it's slick plastic base. However it is nice & low to the ground, and so far we have had no safety concerns. We've never used the removeable plastic seat back, as our little one didn't need it - we got it for her at 16 months, and she could use it right away."
positive,Best drama series,So far it has been the best drama tv series on television.Can't wait for the final 8 episodes.Now what do we watch ?
negative,This is NOT green lipstick,"This product came up when I searched for ""green lipstick"". It is green-colored chapstick that does not color your lips green."
positive,2 Very Good Soundtracks = 1 Great CD,"These are 2 very similar soundtracks. Written in late 80's. I would categorize them as New Age/Chamber Orchestra/Woodwinds. More low key than the westerns Bernstein is most famous for but never the less 2 of his better ones. Nice and pleasant to listen to with each containing a memorable theme. My favorite tracks are 1,9,10,13,16"
negative,Disappointing,"Quality of the individual parts was good. However, the locking mechanism that prevents the winch from slipping in the opposite direction has a weak return spring, and isn't quite lined up with the gear. As a result, it does not lock consistently. Avoid this product if you need a working locking mechanism.I live in Hawaii, so return shipping is not worth the expense and hassle. It's a good size for throwing at the wild pig that visits in my yard at night. Don't need a working locking mechanism for that."
negative,The good deal that wasn't...,"I purchased these sheets as an additional set for a new mattress. The mattress probably measures 16"" in depth. The first time the sheets were put on the bed, they slightly pulled from the centers, i.e. the fitted sheet really just does not fit and snug very well. After washing, the fit continued to get worse. However, it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners. The original set of sheets that I had on my bed were 500TC (from a different manufacturer), and I was so happy with those that I couldn't wait to receive these new ones. Unfortunately, these 600 TC sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 TC ones, nor are they as soft as some 400 TC ones I purchased thereafter. Overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price, but if I had to do it again, I think I'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 TC set."
positive,Received As Part of a Gift Package.......I'm Delighted,"This was part of a L'Occitane gift package from my husband. I love scented, moisturizing soap of high quality during winter. My skin dries up when it's cold. I had never used this soap before, but I will be buying it in the future. It had a wonderful, clean scent that doesn't overpower or interfere with any perfume or cologne I wear. Another plus is that is ultra creamy and moisturizing. It produces a lot of lather. Yup, my skin feels like a baby's.The price listed here seems steep, but this soap bar isn't soft and oozy. It doesn't melt like ordinary soap. This seems fairly typical of specialty soaps; they last longer and don't leave a lot of soapy residue"
negative,Out of date book,This book is way out of date. Many things hve changed in Disney since this was written. I recommend one of the Birmbaum guides instead (especially the Kids version).
negative,Doesn't work on DVD player,I live in the US. This DVD is listed playable in all regions (not just Region 1 which is US and Canada). It plays fine on my computer but my DVD player absolutely does not recognize this DVD. I simply get a message on my TV screen indicating it will not play. My DVD player is only two years old so it should handle this film. The film itself is good and worth watching -- if you have a computer that plays DVD's.
negative,in the middle :-/,"I ordered this because I love RoseAnne.I received it, and it is brand new... like you would buy something in the store. I was satisfied with everything....UNTIL....it would not play in my DVD player!!!How can a brand new DVD not work????So I am very much in middle on this product...I was happy with the product and the shipping time.... but it totally ruins everything when it doesn't even work!!!!! :'("
positive,Great,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and later in life wished I owned it, I finally found it and it's as good as I remember. This movie is great and I'm sure it will be just as memorable to youngsters as it was to me when I saw it all those years ago. This is the kind of thing younger kids should be watching because it is Great and not inappropriate for the younger ages."
positive,Good deal for the price,The laptop is feature wise quite nice though it lacks a few things- it has no internal microphone- keyboard is bit wierd- battery life is a bit short for a 6 cell battery.For the price-tag the laptop is a good buy.
negative,Short lived filters and there are only 3 per box (not 3 sets),"I believe it's necessary to let everyone know that there are only 3 individual filters in the box, not 3 sets as the description says. I purchased this as a replacement for the standard filters that I normally use and because they were cheaper and another review said they would work I figured I'd try it. However, these were not a direct replacement (at least not right out of the box). I was able to get these to fit by cutting off some of the bottom and then they were able to fit, so I was able to use them. The life of these lasted less than a month, but as another reviewer stated, the wicks are a necessary evil."
positive,3 cats and 1 dog.,"I bought this 3 days ago, and wow. First I went at the floors with a pet vacuum. Than I attacked it with this beast.. Clean everywhere, no more stains from pets or baby's formula. The only issue I have is that if you dont have a great vacuum it will leave chunks of fur on the carpet from where you carpet cleaned. However while cleaning up fur chunks is not the highlight of my day, knowing that my carpet is now fur free is GREAT. I call this thing a beast, its big and bulky, I wont lie, but its great. I have not used the attachment yet for my hard floors, but I am sure that will work great as well"
negative,Percy Jackson has stepped in to my life.,"I tried reading Darren Shan's other series,The Demonta,and I could not get through it.So I tried Cirque Du Freak and really liked it.When I read through the third book I just thought it was stupid.Though it didn't stop me from wanting to read the rest of the series.Then when I was waiting for the next book I saw that I had the book The Lightning Theif on my shelf. I decided that I would use it as reading material until I got the fourth Cirque Du Freak book.I started reading The Lightning Theif and immediatley I was hooked.I started begging for more of the series and was not able to read the fourth book of the Cirque.The more I think about it the more I realize that the Cirque is really bland and has no good writing values."
negative,Ann come to Papa!,"I'm gonna give you a good liberal dose of hair reducing WASP repelent. You make Fairfield county look like Germany in '38. Goebbels could have used you. Rush and Sean are using you. This book is even worse than ""How to talk like a liberal (and act like a Moron) if you must!"""
negative,CD function stopped working after 6 months... disappointing,The CD function stopped working after 6 months but the warranty only covered the first 90 days.
positive,"Not As Time Goes By, but nice to watch","A previous reviewer had noted that it was too hard to believe that Judi Dench's character would fall for Michael Williams' character. This might be helped along by the fact that the two were very happily married in real life for many years until he passed away last year.I really enjoy this series, but feel that many people came upon it looking for something more after loving the As Time Goes By series. The dialog and plot lines don't compare, but it does share the sweetness and simplicity. It is a bit slow-moving, even for its genre. Still, it will provide a supplement for those deprived of Judi Dench's wonderful acting now that As Time Goes By has completed its final season."
negative,No is a plasma car is an imitation. I don't like it.,look cheap and not is a plasma car is an imitation. not is the items that describe. Next time dont said that is a plasma car.
positive,Alligator Lopper Electric Chain Saw,Easy to use. Effective on large branches. Relatively lightweight.
positive,My Favorite Movie to Recommend,"Possibly the most miserable waste of time to come by the screen. I hated Turtle Diary and recommend it as often as possible to friends (non of whom have ever heard of it) in hopes that I may be the cause of their misery in watching it. Really it's pointless and tasteless, except that the producer seems so having something for flares of red in an otherwise bland set--this having no connection to the story, but seems as though it should in some twisted way. This movie is always near my top 10 picks in hopes that someone will chance to watch it on my account--a delight of which I have not yet enjoyed--but when said event occurs, I will cackle with glee. Seeing as I anticipate this future merth I easily rate Turtle Diary at 5 stars. I might buy this movie someday when feeling wealthy and unsatisfied with people in general."
positive,Sony does not disappoint,"Like the other reviewer, I initially had a difficult time getting the resolution that I had gotten in a previously owned LCD monitor. I quickly learned that I had the refresh rate set too low for the screen size that I had selected. Once I boosted the refresh to 75, everything fell into place. The image is bright, crisp, and very clear. I use this monitor as one of two that I use for photo editing. The picture quality is often better than my Sony Trinitron monitor. I'm glad I made this purchase."
negative,I didn't lost weight,"I eat it almost 3 weeks ,and regular dinner ,do some sports,but still 150 p .I still hungry ,I t's not work ~"
positive,best there is!!!,I own many instructional books on playing congas and this is simply the best book and dvd that you will find. The instructions and the demos make it very easy to learn even complex rhythms in a very short time. Absolutely outstanding. To anyone who is looking for books on playing congas I say forget all the other books. The Tomas Cruz method is the best there is.
negative,"Lost the ""spirit"" on this CD","This CD is bad. Her first CD there was only 1 song I didn't like...but now on this CD it's so...different... She's better when she doesn't write from her own experiences. All the songs sound the same, they all pretty much say the same thing, and they're all BORING! There's almost no repetative tune in any song to keep the hook going. It's so boring. DO NOT BUY THIS CD! I only hope other great artists out there, like Avril Lavigne, have a better comeback than Michelle does. I don't seen Michelle making a 3rd album. I really don't."
negative,Disappointed,"I thought this was going to be the greatest. But I was disappointed because of the adjustable frame. On the bottom of the frame it's difficult to see in the picture, but their are two thumb screws to adjust the bracket up and down so it lay flat on the bed. If you have a foot board which I do most bed do you need to reach way down between foot board and mattress to get at these screws, and the sheets and blankets are in the way. Very cumbersome this way I take it out and put it back under at night thats how difficult these screws are and caregivers have difficult time need to explain how it works it's hassle. BUT otherwise! It holds the sheets/blankets well and size is good it's made well but this was very disappointing. The white cheaper one which I had was easier to use but not as well made as this one."
positive,Great book and learning experience,"I learned a lot from this book. It's challenging for someone that had been playing only 6 months, but it made me loads better. I loved the first half of the book with it's exploration of different styles of rock, and the continual learning curve that the difficulty of the songs entailed.Only reason for four instead of five stars is that the last half of the book had too many songs of the same style. I can tell Stetina likes metal, but I could have done with a few more styles of rock at this point, as I didn't buy a metal instructional manual, but a rock instructional manual.That being said, a highly recommend you take advantage of a well thought out, and fun, intsructional book."
negative,not that great...,"I would not recomend these, the tweeters are poorly constructed and quite easy to burn out, the crossovers are quite poor and the 6.5"" drivers are very limited in range...i was running these on a cadence 4x50 Watt(rms) amp. (the Q4000) at a masured output of 41Watt RMS (as configured)... in only a few weeks i burned out all but one of the tweeters, and one of the crossovers... the crossovers are a 1st order LP 2nd order HP with a reistor in series with the tweeter... the LP inductor is a iron core wound with 22AWG wire, the hp inductor is at least an air core, but it's made with 26AWG wire... the tweeters mounts are all friction fit and fall apart very easy... the 6.5"" drivers are ok for upper midbass to low midrange, outside of this range it's responce gets quite eratic, and any bass below about 180 HZ will cause distortion across the rest of it's range... all in all these were not worth even the low cost i paid for them."
positive,It is the best in my opinion,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the lot in so far (thats only my opinion). I hope the movie lives up to the book, and i hope they get Sirius Black down. He is my favorite."
negative,Not A Great Role Playing Game,Lunar Dragon Song is not your typical Role Playing Game like Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior. This game becomes very repetitive because you have to play it in 2 modes. 1 to get money to buy items and another to raise your levels. You must fight over and over to get anywhere and this is just a waste of time.The major problem in this game for RPG players is you CAN NOT pick the enemy that you want to attack and you usually attack a weak one and not the one that is beating the crap out of you. This is very annoying and makes you want to just stick it on your shelf and forget the money you spent on it. Just another Disappointing Nintendo DS game in my collection.A remake with a few changes would make this a very nice game but as it stands forget it !!!!!
negative,Breaks Easily,Not well-made. You get what you pay for is the lesson I learned here! My boys broke this toy the same day it came in the mail just with normal play.
positive,powerful!!,this is very powerful for a hand held vac. it picks up everything. the drawbacks are it doesnt charge for use in the car and it is noticeable larger than most hand held vacs.
positive,"Not Pixar's Best, But Pretty Darn Good!","I really like Brave, I really do, but this review is just going to come out sounding very negative, even though on it's own, Brave is a very good movie.The story was good, but it seemed to be a story that's been done before. Kind of like Brother Bear, except with a mother-daughter relationship instead of a pair of brothers.The characters in this movie, were, to me, pretty unlovable. Merida herself I found to be very immature at times. I know this is a coming of age story, but she seemed to just be extraordinarly whiny at times. I did enjoy her brother's antics, they were probably the high point of the movie for me.The music was good, though not very memorable.The animation was beautiful!Overall it was a good movie, it just doesn't compare to Toy Story and Up as far as leaving an impression and being really remarkable goes. And as the first Pixar movie aimed at a female audience, I'd had really high hopes for it."
positive,Good CD...But This Post Below Me Is Stupid,"Hey idiot...it's not Steelheart at all...just the singer, Mike Matijevic. If you had any clue at all you'd know Jason Bonham, Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson & Nick Cantonese were never in Steelheart. Also FYI, all the songs in the movie aren't his voice...for the cover band the actual voice is Jeff Scott Soto. Do your homework next time."
positive,An artist who can go as far as she chooses...,This is one of the most positive songs (Chante's got a man) that I've heard in years. It reaffirms my faith in Black women. There is SOMEONE who recognizes a good man. Thank you Chante!!!
negative,Too many agendas,"I love stories about ice and snow and I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The author has crammed in so many political and scholarly agendas that plot and characterization seem like afterthoughts. Not that I disagree with those agendas, or couldn't be convinced, but this could have been done with more subtlety and skill. The stilted style may be an attempt to imitate the exploreres of the period, and sometimes it succeeds, but more often just comes off as bad writing. The bits of history (human and natural), which were the main draw for me, got lost in the unconvincing and blatantly revisionist struggle between Erasmus, 19th-century New Age guy, and ruthless powermonger Zeke. Ho, hum."
negative,baaaaad!,"I couldn't finish more then 5 minutes of the movie because the quality was so poor, picture watching a tv show with bad reception and it is probably better then this"
negative,"Good brush, bad glue","The brush works really well. The pads are well designed and clean well. However, major draw back as other reviewers have noted is that the glue holding the pad to the base comes off after a couple weeks well before the sponge part shows any wear."
positive,Delightful Characters,"Delightful characters and situations make this book laugh out loud funny at times. Persy, short for Mary Persistence, works as a dog walker at a posh hotel. Jordan Prince, hotel owner and manager, finds the unpredictable, free spirited Persy, a complete enigma -- one he is determined to figure out."
negative,2 paragraphs,"2 paragraphs would have summed the entire book. The repetitive reminders are brutal and take up half of the print. For example: the Race never having to deal with catching up takes up at least an eigth of the book alone. I got it the first time.Mr. Turtledove I love your work, but this was nothing more than a blatant cash (and yes, you got mine) grab. Don't let it ruin you."
positive,Not bad!,"I got the sl400i (instead of the sl300i) so I could stack it with my other components and stream Internet radio stations to my stereo. It was easy to set up and works great.A Web site you log into controls your online media and software you install on your PC lets you select local files to play on your stereo.I have also used it a lot to view slide shows on my TV (I take a lot of digital photos), which is very easy and convenient, and much better than showing them on my PC in my messy office.The only problem I've had so far is my wireless(g) network isn't fast enough. Streamium chokes on large files and especially videos, but I think this is a limitation of network speed rather than the unit itself. Videos are much better with a wired connection.BTW, I learned that trick at streamiumcafe.com, a forum site with all sorts of info and suggestions."
negative,Conway Twitty DVD,I was so disappointed in the quality of this DVD. Conway Twitty is one of my favorite singers and I have enjoyed his music for years. I was so looking forwarding to seeing him perform via DVD. It was impossible to see him clearly because the video was SO blurry. There was so much blackness that just ruined the performance. It made me very sad.
negative,Sucks,"I used to take Hydroxy once in a while to drop a couple of pounds. I run, exercise and eat low cal. I am 5'5"" and used to weight 125lbs. I wanted to drop 5 for summer and instead gained 5lbs in three days on this pill.Don't take it. I am bloated and feeling gross"
positive,Greenbook,I am planning on selling some of my Snowbabies and need this information for pricing. This will be a great help
negative,PAINFUL,"This game is so easy sometimes and yet extremely difficult when it's not supposed to be. The lie has no effect on the distance. You can chip in 9 out of 10 times around the green. If you are in the woods, forget it. There is no way to judge your lie. There is no difference in swing speed between a driver and a wedge. All clubs swing the same exact way. I gave the game away."
positive,MORE MORE MORE,wish she could push books out as fast as j. patterson....love her writing. Loved the Blood Colony series most of all.
positive,Works exactly as described.,I've successfully made the best labne (Lebanese yogurt) for my Lebanese husband who declared it was superior to any he's tasted before. Great product.
negative,What happened...?,"This album is both great and dissapointing at the same time.Classic Metallica song writing, with strong vocals and great lyrics. The album, however suffers from terrible, sub-standard production values. What happened???? After 4 or 5 tracks the snare drum becomes very annoying making the music difficult to listen to. This same team, Metallica and Bob Rock, have produced great albums and set the tone with the production values on the ""Black"" album and every Metallica recording since. This one sounds like a demo and not a polished Metallica recording.Sorry to say but the production is just not there and if that was thier intent, what a bad decision that was! Someone should have double check this recording before letting it go to press."
positive,Very Entertaining Movie,"Very much enjoyed this movie. Didn't get a chance to see it in the movies, but had friends over for the viewing and they commented how much it was like being at the movies. I have HD and Surround which brought the movie to life."
negative,The LAST RAKOSH a giant ripoff,"I have read every F.Paul Wilson 'repairman Jack' novel. I usually find his books nice light reading. His last effort 'The LAST RAKOSH' is not a new book. All the author did was take his novel 'ALL THE RAGE', remove two thirds of the story and reprint the rest of it under a new title. Read the last page of both stories, they are identical. I paid $4.99 for the special edition of all the rage, nice price and a nice book. I then paid $14.95 to buy The LAST RAKOSH. What a giant ripoff. I really feel that Mr. Wilson and his publishers should be ashamed. So save your money and but All The Rage. Why waste your money on one third of the story. I think Mr. Wilson owes my $14.95 plus shipping!Mr. Wilson is lucky I don't know how to find Repairman Jack."
positive,Great sequel,"If you liked the first one, this sequel is a winner as well. Brian Dennehy does a great job and worth viewing and owning."
negative,"The worst online purchase, Wondering why Amazon.com not helping me.","This program which was purchased through Amazon.com did not open in my well-functioning desktop computer. I complained of the problem through e-mail but the manufacturer(Global Software Publishing)asked nonsense questions regarding my well-functioning computer. They never mentioned re. refund. On the registration form, U.S.A. is not listed, so you cannot register and the program would work. I complained to Amazon.com which my whole family trust, did not help me, either. Our family is wondering, why Amazon.com included this item in their business.The rate of this item is much less than 1 star !!!"
negative,Not the Best Guide for Travelers,I've read and used both this book and Moon's Costa Rica Handbook. The latter is by far the better of the two and contains about twice the information.
positive,Gluten-Free 101,"This cookbook was exactly what I was looking for. Simple recipes, clear instructions, tasty food. The only downfall I had was finding a few of the ingredients. Most of the flours and starches are available at a number of local grocery stores. But others I had to find online and didn't offer items in smaller quantities for trial purposes."
negative,damaged goods,"Twice, I never got to use this tool because they came severely damaged from shipment. The inside packaging is so weak the heavy tool is easily broken."
negative,Depends on your Noise Issue - No Good for Cubicles,"I bought one to help deal with the folks at work. I sit in a cubicle all day and was about to loose it listening to all the loud, click-clack keyboards, mouse clicking and scrolling, phone conversations, bad eating manners and etc. It was suggested that I get a white noise machine. Well.....it didn't help. You can still hear everything that you wish you didn't have to listen to all day. It sounds like a loud fan running and I agree with the woman that said that the design/color is just awful. I had to hide the machine on my desk to prevent the starring as people walked by."
positive,Interesting Book,"Really fascinating story behind an American legend. If you like military novels, precision shooting, and/or historic wartime accounts you must read this book."
positive,Strap yourselves in...,"This is it...probably one of the best mixes ever to be captured on one cd. This magik mix, the first of many, is what sets Tiesto apart from the rest of the pack. Nobody, not even Paul Van Dyk, Oakenfold, or Armin van Buuren, NOBODY can mix, produce, or simply pick good tunes like DJ Tiesto.From the minute you put this in your cd-rom drive, you will be mesmerized, at times to the point where you will want to get off your seat and dance...it is THAT good. The vocals, harmonies, and beats of each song are so well-coordinated into one continuous sound that you will swear this was mixed digitally and not by mere hands. Magik is certainly an appropriate name for this album because there was definitely a good amount of it utilized in the inception of this mix.No matter how much criticism Tiesto receives or how bad any of his recent sets may have been in the eyes of those resentful of his popularity and success, he will always be #1, simply for this mix alone."
negative,Would have been nicer if it lasted longer,"Bought and installed in May '11, stopped working Jan '12. The locking mechanism no longer locks. I now get a""check fuel cap"" warning indicator. Oh well."
negative,Sh*t,"Isn't it amazing what the music industry has come to. We have 11 year old playing possibly the gayest music imaginable. I hear that either Aaron Carter or his brother is a Metallica fan. Maybe he should pick up a guitar and learn how to do something other then sing someone elses lyrics, and try to make decent music. Until then, we shouldn't have to b subjected to such garbage."
positive,NOW THIS IS A CLASSIC ALBUM!!,When you find a Reba album where all the songs are first class material and she does an outstanding job on every one of them...you'd better hold on to it tight because this is rarely the case any more. This is one of her very best!! Every song is Class A stuff and Reba is simply grand!!! Bravo!!
positive,"Great idea, poor execution","I was just about to order a replacement for my Namco toymax when I checked some of the other reviews that just about all of them had the same problem. ""Toy stopped working"" or ""Joystick Brocken after 2 weeks"". Unfortunately it appears that this is the same for my most awesome toy. It was a gift that brought joy to my TV and then after 1 week nothing but distortion. That being said I wouldn't waste [the money] on the item when you can go buy one of the old floor models that you put quarters in. The difference is that at least it will work longer!"
positive,Most interesting book about the Titanic,"I read this book during my summer vacation and I thought it was really interesting. This book was so great, as soon as I bought it i couldn't stop reading it. All the facts are true and at some parts it made me kind of sad to see that so many people had died and there was plenty of room on the life boats. I guess some people were very stubborn in those times. The fact is if you enjoy the Titanic then this is the type of book you would enjoy because it gives you the perspective of some of the survivors."
negative,Dead out of the gate....,"This movie never really had a chance, because the previews for it tell you before you ever see it that the caller is inside the house. That and the fact that it was a remake basically kills the premise, because as soon as the stranger of the title starts calling you know where he is, and it becomes an exercise in frustration because you know everything that the girl doesn't, so there's no tension because you end up just sitting there waiting for her to find out what you knew before you sat down. The original worked because they left some secrets for you to find out in the end, but this one seems to be trying hard to keep it under wraps when everyone already knows. And if you already know the biggest part of the movie going in, then what's the point?"
negative,Wouldn't buy it again,"I've owned mine for about three years and am now looking for something less messy and less loud. It takes a good couple of minutes to grind enough for a single cup of coffee, and if you're trying to do this while someone is still asleep, household discord can arise. Because the canister for the grounds does not sit firmly onto the grinder, you have to stand around while its grinding to keep it from coming off. Perhaps because the burrs have become dull, for about a year now I have to regularly hit the top of the container to keep feeding the beans through the grinder as it operates; otherwise it gets stuck and no beans are ground. All of this fuss leads to a pretty messy counter. Braun definitely needs to improve on this design."
positive,Pleased,"We bought this for my dad for Christmas, so we haven't actually watched it. But it came quickly and we're excited to give it as a gift. The reason for 4 stars is I thought I was getting a great deal because it was advertised as $30 off, but later I found it at Costco which regular price was $5 cheaper then what we paid."
negative,Not compatible with psp 2000,The openings do not allow access to the headphone jack. Meaning if you wanted to use headphones with this case you would have to take the psp out. Kinda defeats the purpose. Also the switch for wifi in the psp 2000 is on top and there is no access hole for that either. Functional only for old psp edition.
positive,Gives insight into Haitian culture that only fiction can.,"This is an amazing collection of short stories that read like poetry, and remind one of Haitian paintings. They play on the emotion, and capture a sense of what it must feel like to be a Haitian. The short stories are poetry to those who like poetry, they are anthropology for those who seek a better understanding of the culture, and they a feminist literature for those who would define it as such.While some might find them ""overdone"", I find them magnificent, like Haitian art."
positive,Quality of the Christmas Yule Log Fireplace,"We also have this product on VCR tape. The tape is not as clear as the DVD, but the DVD is much darker than the tape. We kind of like our tape a little better. Of course, the DVD has nice features the tape doesn't have since we can play it with or without music."
negative,... Racing,"This game, to me, was horribly made. It had no ""new"" aspect or quality that hasn't been done many times before, no part of this game sets itself apart from any other racing game from the Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis. Their are NO physics in this game, now I think that physics are a crucial part of any racing game, as we are in the 21st century and it's not very hard to see that to make a game real, you need realistic physics! Their's no drifting, sliding, ""realistic"" jumps or even realistic turning, everything depends on your 3 stats, which means that the creators we're just very lazy people, or they don't know we have a little known word, called ""gravity"". The levels are very plain, nothing stands out, your just racing around within the borders of a type of fence or barrier, so theirs no exploring. What you should do, is just play it smart and wait for Gran Turismo 3 to come out, and get the best of the racing genre."
negative,AWFUL,I have been wanting an ice cream maker for about 3 years. I finally recieved this one for christmas this year. This is an awful machine and will be going back to the store tomorrow. It never makes ice cream. All it does is spin milk around for 35 mins with no other effect. Don't waste your time or money!
negative,Horrible Headset! Here's why!,"I recently purchased this headset believing the other customer comments on it. Also, I have never been unhappy with Panasonic. However, now I don't think some of them have ever used other headsets before, because this headset flat out BITES! You can't hear very well on it and my friend that I talk to every day complains that it sounds like I'm on a speakerphone. My old headset that I bought for [less] sounds much better on both ends. I think the noise canceling on this thing actually cancels too much! Trust me, it's not as good as most Panasonic products!"
positive,Great Diamond classic in High Definition,"When I got this DVD combo pack, I was impressed by the cover and the packaging. I watched the Blu-Ray in my room the day after. For those of you confused about the Blu-Ray and DVD combo packs, this is how it works. Blu-Ray combos involve the small, blue package with the DVD behind the Blu-Ray discs. The DVD combo has the Black edged packaging with the DVD in front of the Blu-Ray discs. I liked the DVD combo better because of it's nice cover and grip. If you want it in Hd, buy the DVD combo pack."
negative,Poor execution,"Lovely looking machine with great promise, but it has not performed reliably. Sometimes it does not pump enought water, most times the foamer leaks while coffee is being made. We are returning it. We will try another one, but the one we started with was certainly a lemon. Plus, the customer help line was not very helpful."
negative,Was She Pretty by Leanne Shapton,"I ordered this book after seeing a clever slide show of drawings by Leanne Shapton in the New York Times. ""Was She Pretty"" did not satisfy my desire for more. It was repetitive, to say the least, and, quite frankly, a little boring. The drawings were not as good as the group that inspired my purchase. I do not recommend......wish I did."
negative,Mom of 3,"I own two of them (unfortunetly for me). The reason I give 2 stars is because the corded part of the phone works fine, answereing machine is fine. Cordless on the other hand stinks. You could charge for ever and still only have about 15 minutes of talk time, when the charge runs out, your done for atleast another 15 hours or so before it will hold a charge again. Currently looking for a new phone, I'll let ya know when I find one."
positive,Great Series,Actually read this entire series and really liked it. Easy read with great characters and good plot and lots of action at the end.
negative,Not what I expected,"Look carefully at this picture. If you're expecting a chair with a lumbar support, an adjustable frame and adjustable arms, look elsewhere."
positive,Queen of the underground,"I first came to know of Jane Jensen after watching the movie Tromeo and Juliet. I was just so intrigued by this adorable creature that played Juliet I just had to find out more about her. To my surprise, I discovered that she made music too. So I just had to get this album since I have such a weakness for female singers. While I must admit with my first listen I thought ""What the #@$% is this."" I gave it a fair chance though, and the more I listened to it. The more I liked it. So much so I had to track down her first album as well."
positive,Don Chance knows his Derivatives!,"I am just about done with my MBA, and I have to say this is must-have book for the shelf. I read it cover to cover and now I find myself going to it for quick reference. It is really comprehensive and very thorough. The language is not the usual dense ""academese,"" and I am most thankful to have--set forth in three short essays toward the end of the book--the differences in option pricing theory. This is the best overview on option pricing I've read yet."
positive,Music to play by !,"My son is going through a phase of building Star Wars models, and loves to listen to this CD while building and playing with them. Being a professional musician, I was impressed with the quality of the recording and the orchestra. Well worth the price..."
negative,"Can't use, can't return","I bought this product and then found out that it will not work for my particular type of balding. Now I cannot return it even though I never opened it and I'm out $85. Further, I also found out that if you ever stop using Rogaine, you're hair falls out quicker than if you never used it at all. WARNING: If you buy this, it cannot be returned, it only works on one specific type of baldness, and if you ever stop using, all your hair will fall out."
positive,"Decent, reliable book","I can recommend this book, especially as a place to start and to get an initial feel and importance for various terms. I've actually used it ato look up a couple dozen words so far."
positive,G-SHOCK,"Looks like good product... Nonetheless, did not come with instruction manual. Thank God it was easy to figure out. Concerned about fastener, made of plastic, worried it will break easily. I guess it's ok for the price..."
positive,Seven Pillars of Life,This book plus 2 added journals are very helpful. The information is clearly written and easy to follow. Each day of this journey brings an understanding of how God intended us to live. I can feel the energy growing and my health is revitalized. I will use these steps for the rest of my life.
positive,Very Enlightening and also Biblical,"I thought the book was very well written, and gave a unique perspective on the Kingdom of God, as oppose to the kingdom of this world. I recommend anyone who wants a taste of this book to check out an excellent sermon by Boyd entitled taking America back for God, located at his churches website, whchurch.org, under sermon resources, april 2004. It is an excellent sermon that adds excitement to what this book explains."
positive,Stop the clutter-find a battery,"It's so convenient to have batteries organized in one spot, rather than rattling around in a drawer. It's easy to find what you need and see when it's time to stock up. I also have the optional tester which is very handy."
negative,"If you liked ""The Complex"", but want more drums, here you go","After seeing the Complex Rock Tour, I was blown away by the Blue Man Group. When I ordered the tour video, I also ordered ""Audio,"" and it blew me away even more! If you want something a little more raw, and with a lot more percussion, than ""The Complex,"" you NEED this CD! It's a little less polished and doesn't have vocals getting in the way. Make sure your subwoofer's warmed up and CRANK IT! This CD has to be on any percussion fans top 10 list."
negative,BEWARE: THIS IS NOT A REMASTERED RECORDING!,"The songs and voice of Joan Baez are great but do not expect a HD CD that is remastered. In fact while playing the CD there is an on/off rumbling noise in the background that resembles a helicopter flying over the studio while this CD is being recorded! The seller should not advertise this CD as remastered when it is not. There is no word of that on the CD itself or CD case and my player does not show HD CD when the CD is loaded. I bought this CD because it said it is remastered, which would improve the sound quality significantly."
negative,Total junk,I owned this for less than 2 weeks when it stopped working and began to smell like it was burning. I returned it for a refund.
positive,Thought provoking... a great film!,"As someone of partial Native American ancestry I felt this movie did an excellent job of presenting in a short period of time the past atrocities committed and the continuing impact on indigenous communities today in many parts of the world. It was compelling to see the change in mindset of this intelligent group of filmakers and to see them defend the indigenous community to their government even though they were afraid to do so. It was a though provoking, emotional film that carries the message that it is time for all of us to wake up and see what is happening in our world today."
positive,movie series-NCIS,Fantastic DVD..........hope to buy all the other DVDs. Good price and very quick shipment.
negative,"Good on paper, not in practice","In order for these well-thought-out, simple guidelines to work, you have to be involved in a professional atmosphere in which negotiation is possible. The guidance and counsel offered in this book simply will NOT work with, say, a micromanager hung up on getting things done HIS way or no way at all. I have loaned this book to several co-workers who have concluded the same.If your work place is open to professional input and ideas for improvement (even where office politics run rampant), the book might work. But if your work place is run by an aggressive, incurable micromanager (who continues to deny that he is one) your money might be better spent in, say, therapy."
positive,Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron Soundtrack,Did you like the Movie ' Spirit: Stallion Of the Cimarron'?Well if you liked the songs and themes of Spirit you'll love this beautiful soundtrack.
positive,excellent,this is one of the best albums of ALL TIME by ANY artist. its one of those rare albums where nearly all of the tracks are AWESOME SONGS.get this. it is definitely Stabbing Westward's best album by far.some of the best tracks: oh wait. all of them? except maybe 10-12 which are quieter and slower. and the first title track is kinda meh but its more just filler than anything else.GO!
negative,This book is too slooooow!,"Ok, so I bought this book with great expectations . But do I get? The first chapters are good and promising, but... Mr. Salvatore, you are a good writer, but this...Yuck! Too tedious, too long-winded (we all know what is gooing to happen in the end!) - and TOO BOORING!!!!!"
positive,"Michael Caine Rules, Hallstrom Does Too","Director Lasse Hallstrom, who gave us the beautiful ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", admirably presents the nuances of character, emotion, and relationships that make John Irving's bittersweet adaptation of his own novel so compelling. Michael Caine, his American accent aside, excels as the parternal Dr. Larch and Tobey Maguire is well-cast as Homer, the doe-eyed youth who ventures from the familial orphanage to experience life. The cinematography is exquisite and evocative. As Homer ultimately learns, the validity of the Cider House Rules (and, by extension, all rules) is subjective; but, by the time we reach this epiphany, it hardly seems revelatory considering Homer was raised by an abortionist, and one who taught him the trade, at that. There is a lot of love here, but also a moral ambivalence. In this film, as in life, there are no easy answers. It's for you to decide. Just be sure you see it."
negative,This product really isn't what I'm looking for. ...,"This product really isn't what I'm looking for. If you have thin, fine hair, like me, I think a better product is """"Thicker Fuller Hair"""". While the hairdressing Gel from Alberto V05 does provide manageability, I prefer simply using hair spray (although some men probably shy away from that). I used the product after washing my hair and the results were okay, but I think the product would be better suited for someone with a different type of hair. I wouldn't buy this product for myself."
negative,Good pr?,"I bought this album after reading rave reviews.There are some moments on the album, but a lot of the music is so contrived and I feel like I have heard all the stuff before.I listen to the album and can't get the thought out of my head that the record stores are full of this type of stuff.A cool name is a good start."
negative,"Great songs, good vocals, terrible arrangement","Given the great songs and the vocal talents, this CD set is a major disappointment. Simple laments are overwhelmed by big orchestral flourishes and merry percussive beats. Complete betrayal of of the sentiments of most of the songs. Only if there is a way to strip away all the accompaniment..."
negative,Nothing special here,"The scissors part cuts well. The major problem with this is that the spring between the two handles falls out all the time when it is open. Once cut, then the spring falls out. Put it back in and one cut and the spring falls out. Don't waste your money on this."
negative,Not so great,This machine worked well at first on really simple stuff but is not good for the long haul or anything more complex. The thread becomes a rats nest on the bottom and messing with the tension can take years! This is great if you will always use thin fabric and sew in straight lines.
positive,The Art of Seduction,"Coco is a retired exotic dancer. She's now selling sex toys and teaching stripper classes. Her daughter, Ginger definitely has not emulated mom. She's in training to be a pastry chef. She disapproves and is a bit ashamed of her mother. Ginger's at the opposite end of the spectrum, straight-laced and well...sexually repressed. But when she discovers she's ill-equipped to entice the man she's after, she turns to dear old mom for some mother advice on the art of seduction. This book is a fast and fun read. It's a tad bit naughty...but just a tad."
positive,A really nice compliment to other barre workouts,"I started barre workouts way back with the Lotte Berk series, moved on to Burr Leonard and last year, Exhale's, all of which I really enjoy. I was still looking for something a little more cardio but in this same genre and I found it with Xtend Barre. I LOVED this DVD - it was fun, reminded me a little of my ballet classes as a kid and it really gave me what I was looking for on the days I need more cardio. Andrea is a great instructor, perfect! I still love Burr's new DVD's and Exhale's, but this is going to be a staple in my DVD rotation. Love it and highly recommend it!! As a side note, I am a dressage rider and while I loved the visual results from the Jillian Michael's series, it virtually ruined my riding, which I find interesting since Jillian herself is a dressage rider. This DVD is perfect for including cardio while also allowing my body to remain supple and flexible, which is a must in the saddle."
negative,too bad you can't give 0 stars.,"When I heard FLY on the radio I loved the song so much I just HAD to get the CD. Little did I know the rest of it is hard rock and heavy metal CRAP! And right after I got FLOORED I got sick of the song FLY. Now whenever I hear that song I feel like gagging. And the other songs on the CD are ten times worse! Unless you are one of those people who like this kind of thing (heavy metal blasting into you're ears that some people actually call 'music'), take my advise and save your money."
positive,Quiet but strong,"I have purchased this juicer after buying at least 5 different juicers that have let me down. This is the first masticating juicer i've purchased and i am happy with it. Easy to use, easy to clean, your fresh juice will be ready in no time. The omega juicers make it easier to incorporate more healthy options in your diet. I highly reccomend it!"
positive,perfect book for topic,"I had to buy this book for one of my International Relations classes, and any fellow student knows there are basically no textbooks worth getting excited over. This, however, is an exception. It's not your typical drag-on, historical fact after historical fact textbook. This is a very conversational, plainly written, semi-sarcastic compialation of US foreign policy interventions. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
negative,Rayovac makes false claims,"Rayovac vouches just as good as Duracell. I am very upset with purchase I recently bought. (not amazon, but Wally world)......... My Duracells last months, these Rayovacs didn't even last a week. Faulty, cheap, and misleading. Returning them and will never will buy Rayovac again!"
negative,a joke,"This is the biggest excuse for punk music I have ever heard. First of all Good Charlotte never sold out, they always were this bad. Good Charlotte is the new brand of boy bands appealing to young girls and guys with no taste in music. So dont waste your time and read all these reviews from 13 year old girls who will listen to anything popular. Instead go buy cds such as The Used and Taking Back Sunday"
positive,Some kool stuff about the game.,"Some Kool stuff about the game are:1. You get to desing your own horse.2. You get to go fast.3. You get to solve mysteries.4. graphics are cool.5. You get to talk to people.6. Music is ok.7. You get to choose from Lisa, Carole, or Stevie.The clue I got stuck on was finding the golden thing in the castle, wich turns out to be behind one of the sheds. I play it most of my spare time, this is probaly one of my favorite horse games."
positive,Genius,"Genius, absolute. Restored my faith in music. Not one filler on it.Its makes u cry(My Immortal), it makes u rock(Haunted).If you don't like this, you are already dead.This girl must have sold her soul to the devil for this voice.Will take you places you didn't know existed.Nuff said."
positive,Best Metal Group Around,Tora Tora...one of the most underrated groups of the late 80's / early 90's. They are great! This album is a classic. I would love to hear something from them soon.
positive,Thick and Strong Cables,"This is a great security cable for the back of the truck or a storage bay to secure items to a permanent structure such as a wall or chassis. Nothing flimsy about it. The cable is 15mm thick wich is more than half inch in diameter and the hard plastic linning is sturdy and rigid. You would need a big set of Bolt Cutters to be able to cut through these and then because they are rope like metal strand fibers that make up the cable it would not be an easy task for anyone to cut through them, so you'd probably have to use a cutting saw (electric or gas) with a metal cutting blade. In other words, this is a high level security cable that would take a very deliberate and substantial effort to override. Recommend."
positive,Colt Seavers!,"I've been wanting this set for quite a while and at this price, it was a no-brainer. I have fond memories of watching this as a kid and I was not disappointed when I sat down and burned through the first two DVDs in one night. Yes, it is cheesy, but it is a fun watch and getting to introduce my son to the Fall Guy is absolutely priceless for me.Now, if they would just get around and release the rest of the series, I would be a very happy man."
negative,Just ordinary. Aimed at the amateur,"I guess this DVD would be okay if you just bought your first digital camera or didn't understand the basics of photography, but it sure doesn't help at all with the advanced features of this camera.Throughout this DVD the instructor refers to ""Part Two"" where all the advanced features will be explained. Trouble is there is no ""Part Two"". I emailed the company twice trying to determine when ""Part Two"" would be available but they never responded. Great cutomer service, huh?I'm sorry I bought it. $25 down the drain."
negative,Just Say No to Reading This!,"What I thought started out to be a pretty good read, turned into pure torture after the first chapter as I struggled for more than three weeks to finish this book. For a person that usually finishes a book in a 24 hr. time frame, that's an eternity!! I suggest that next time you leave out writing lyrics and beats. Especially over and over. Most readers are more interested in the story. Thank God I read a copy from the library."
negative,Wrong Format for CD,This product was billed as a CD. The first copy was in an MP-3 format and would not play on any regular CD player. The replacement copy still was in an unknown format and would not play.
negative,not impressed!,"These batteries did not last more than 30 minutes in a red dot, they should have lasted 120 hours. I will not purchase these again."
negative,King of Cool? More like King of Cornpone!,"I have tried hard to like these songs, but they are relentlessly corny and Dean basically just phones in the vocals. Sinatra wouldn't be caught dead singing this collection of tinny tunes."
negative,Unless someone is making you buy it...,"Don't! This book is poorly written, difficult to interpret, full of typos, and just generally a waste of the cognitive resources Sudman talks about the precious scarcity of. It is repetitive, long-winded, and poorly organized, leaving the reader wondering what the authors were even trying to say. The information within this book, though, is critical to understanding good survey construction. If you can find an outline or abbreviated version of this information hold onto it!"
negative,A Complete Disappointment,"I don't know whether it is because I was so excited about the sequel to my favorite novel and ruined it for myself, but Blackhouse is a total disgrace and a bore to read, until around page 500. Even the ending is a disappointment by The Talisman's standards. Where it takes me less than a week to finish one of King's novels, this book took me 2 months! It was just out of pure respect for King that I finished this novel otherwise I would have returned it after the second chapter."
positive,My go anywhere tool,Good for its size and what it does. Unless you want to carry around half a studio with you this does the job just fine if you travel from place to place like me. I like to keep 2 setups. My quick setup for travel and my hard setup for when I'm back home. My gear surrounds both of these styles. This one is in my travel kit along with my AEF filter my other road dog tool. I finally figured out how to make a studio in any hotel room I'm at. Life is good!
positive,excellent album,"bought this album a few months back from amazon mp3 and have been enjoying it ever since. It has remained on constant circulation on my iPhone and will continue to do so.It's well worth it's regular price, so if you can snag it for the daily deal price even better!"
positive,Worth it,"This toy was purchased for a party with several kids from 2 to 12 years old. They all loved it! Not only did it last through heavy use at the party, but it still lives in a little girls room. Well loved!"
positive,a journey worth taking,"Frank Darabont's adaptation of The Green Mile was one of last year's best films. On DVD it looks even better. Although the film runs nearly three hours it still never gets boring and never lacks the human spirit. Tom Hanks is a stand out as the head of the Mile. The supporting cast is also solid, especially Micheal Clarke Duncan and David Morse. This is filmmaking at its very best. Trust me you won't regret this trip."
negative,So-So product,"I can't say that I own very many of these things, this was in fact my first venture into USB webcams. I was a bit disappointed in the software that came with it and as many have pointed out, image is decent in well lit areas but not at all acceptable in darker settings. USB is the only cost effective way to go for chat cams were quality isn't critical."
negative,Only for the hard-core or for historical research,"I love juju music, and I love old recordings from the 30s and 40s (lots of old Hawaiian, Bluegrass, and early Singing Cowboy discs in my collection). I usually don't mind the LP noise because that's part of the package. In this case, however, I was very disappointed--angry, really--at the poor job of remastering the vinyl or orignial tapes to CD. For the first few tracks, I could barely hear the music above the clicks and hisses. It was only at about the two-thirds mark through the CD that the music was louder than the noise. Furthermore, I found that less than half of the music sounded even remotely like juju music--probably about a third. I really doubt that the earliest, middle-eastern sounding tracks(from what I could tell through the noise) had any role in the creation and evolution of juju. A guide to World Music that I read called this disc ""essential."" I call it a ripoff."
positive,History Repeats Itself,"The good thing about this book is, as another reviewer has put it, that its author is a ""writer who happens to be an historian"" rather than vice-versa. ---In other words, it has an authorial voice----Unfortunately, that's also the not so good thing about it. While we are kept turning the pages with droll quips and the like, the attentive reader won't fail to notice that these quips become repetitive. Not only that, but Porter uses the same citations to make exactly the same point in different chapters. Stylism in history writing doesn't always play so fast and loose, but it does here.Several of the reviewers seem to have read this work as a classroom assignment, their first exposure to Eighteenth Century England beyond Hollywood (for at least one reviewer). For such, this book is probably just the ticket. Those looking for more depth and less anecdote will need to turn elsewhere."
positive,Bad Move,"I'm three-quarters through the book, but so far it is taking a longtime to get to the point. The main character Zack Walker seems like a major lier. So far he hasn't been truthful to anyone. Not sure if I'll read the other three in the series."
positive,Great teacher for beginners,"I was a backyard rink player as a kid and never had the benefit of a coach. When I began to pick up the game as an adult this year I bought numerous books on ""how to"" play hockey. Mr. Falla's book was by far the best for me.Simple explanations of the game and how to play it.Not too technical, not too long, and just right for me.HIghly recommended."
negative,Poor.,"The blu-ray transfer for this loked fairly appalling to my eye. Each layer of depth looked overly independent and made the film look very false. I don't know of a better way to describe it, but even at the very low black friday price I would rather buy a regular dvd copy and watch that. Not recommended."
positive,Excellent,"This book is very well organized, both in contents and in chronology. I really enjoyed the writing style, in which the issues are covered by example, rather than a more aggressive ""do this, don't do that"" approach."
negative,Not what I expected,"I'm not usually very harsh in my criticism of CDs. I realize music is subjective, and one person's trash is another person's treasure. HOWEVER, this ""steel drum band"" CD turned out to be a single steel drum playing over top of a ""drum machine"" (stiff MIDI sequences utilizing low-end sound libraries, for you musicians out there). Actually, I'm not even positive that the steel drum is live, it might be MIDI (fake) as well. The guitar sounds live, and the player likes to insert solos as often as possible, as though he's a frustrated guitarist who is using the lure of ""steel drums"" to trick people into listening to his guitar solos. I found this CD to be very disappointing."
positive,ONCE AGAIN!,"All I can say is AMAZING. I didn't think they could match their last album but they did. The lyrical content is mind blowing. God is smiling down on this album for sure. This is where Boyz II Men picked up their vocal styles. If your a new Commissioned fan I suggest getting ""Irreplaceable Love"" as well. Boyz II Men wrote on that album and it is beautiful. This is a MUST BUY!"
positive,These guys are the best!,"Spineshank is a great band. Good guitar, heavy and powerful. They sing nice and all of a sudden they scream and get really heavy. It's sorta like Deftones but Spineshank is better. If you like that kinda music you'll love the Spineshank cd."
positive,Great shoe storage,"This is the best system for organizing shoes. I bought this to get my shoes organized and it is great. However, I am glad that I wasn't planning on putting my husband's shoes in this too because they DO NOT fit. He wears size 10-11 and only one shoe would fit per cube. My shoes fit nicely though. Like the other reviews state, this is very time consuming to put together, but I feel like it was worth it. Once assembled, it is very sturdy. I liked that you can configure this how you want. It fits my space perfectly because I was able to build it the way I wanted."
negative,Predictable and cliche...,"When I finished this book - which I had to force myself to do - I felt like I had just finished watching an overplayed Lifetime movie. The plot was incredibly predictable. The characters were underdeveloped, so there was no hope of liking or feeling sympathy for any of them. Even the physical descriptions seemed contradicting; I couldn't decide if Simon was supposed to be handsome and suave or dirty and creepy. Some of the descriptions and phrases were so overly cliche that I had to roll my eyes. The dialogue was forced and mechanical. All of the conservative, religious and/or pro-life characters in the book were depicted as closed-minded, condescending, and sometimes murderous lunatics. Some of the narratives were clearly rants about religion, conservatism, pro-life thinking, and self-control. Overall, this book was unfulfilling and frustrating. If you're looking for a good, thoughtful read, I would avoid this."
negative,Overly Dramatized and Sterotypical,"In the book Kabul Beauty School, the author manipulates her personal relationships with these women and writes an overly dramatized and sterotypical story with many mistakes and factual errors on Afghan cultural. She also writes with a sense of superiority while ignoring the shortcomings in her own personal life."
positive,Check Out Greg's Music,"Greg Greenway is a hidden musical treasure. He sings from the heart with conviction. Great voice, lyrics and messages. Also check out the latest collaboration with Joe Jencks and Pat Wictor...Brother Sun."
positive,I like Olie!,"I like this book very much, but it's not as much of a favorite for the 2 year olds that I bought it for. They enjoy the board books more. I think part of the problem is the funky type that the words are written in. The other part may be that I'm willing to let younger hands be rougher with board pages than I am with paper pages. I'm a big fan of Olie."
positive,Extraordinary Tell-All Book On How One Widow Overcame Grief,"The author presents an autobiography of how she overcame the loss of her husband when she was just 27-years-old. Hirsch describes in vivid detail the emotions she suffered and how she overcame her debilitating grief through a series of healing processes that resulted in her own spiritual transformation. This tell-all book leaves nothing to the imagination and guides the reader into an unexpected, but welcomed, succession of events that may challenge some religious minds when the author discovers that life does exist after death. A must-have book for the overlooked younger generation of widows or for anyone interested in overcoming grief resulting from the loss of a loved-one."
negative,It's NOT all about food,"Being overwieght minus medical conditions IS possibleBeing Obese does not mean you Are unhealthy, just as being thin makes you healthy. There are way too many Additives And preservatives and chemicals in the food supply which contribute to the medical conditions. Once we take all the flavorings, ""spices"" etc out of Food, well be ok. Diet food is loaded With chemicals to make Them Taste better. Obesity is NOT the issue. Its the FDA."
negative,EZ close,We have two of these on one storm door and this product has been a total bust. They allow the door to slam shut and it can not be adjusted to hold no matter what you do. I would definitely not recommend these.
positive,A very good album,This album is very good. It has an amazing song Birth Machine 2000 and the rest are very good. It is in the same formula as the Carnival Bizarre . Domm metal but not boring and slow as their first album. Well their best album till this one is Th Carnival Bizarre. A must for all Cathedral fans.
negative,Poor Show,In this day and age you'd expect a game within this costing bracket to have a better interface and functionality. Probably rushed through to coincide with the end of the World Cup.
positive,Childhood Memories,Great to have this series on dvd! Watched reruns of this cartoon in the morning before elementary school. Reminds me when I was a child.
negative,Unmemorable Psych-Fluff,"Not to be confused with the US '60s band Kaleidoscope, this is a UK 60's outfit whose output consisted of really wimpy psychedelia sung by high, non-descript voices. The instrumentation lacks any meat, but if you like things like Donovan's more embarrassingly hippy-dippy songs, then this may be for you. Otherwise gets pretty boring."
positive,The story is enchantingly told by a great writer.,"The story of the Authurian legends are twisted with the creativity of Mary Stewart's imagination to create this enchanting telling of Merlin and his very own Aurthur. Stewart creates a fictional character named Ralph that the childhood of today's day and age can relate to. You follow Merlin's conquest through his trouble's and his trimphs until the very end of the book. It is suspenseful until the end, but doesn't give up then. It keeps you reading until the very last word. The only dislike that I have come to with this book is the fact that it is slow to get in to, but aren't the best understood books tht way? You must have a basis for what you are reading even if you haven't read the rest of the saga. (The first book) as I hadn't when I sat down to enjoy this well told story."
positive,Does it get any sweeter?,Has all the right actors and full of what a romantic comedy should be! I have watched it many times since I purchased it. Once I watched it with my husband I just had to take it to my friends and watch it with them!
negative,P-U,"Based on all the rave reviews read on the product, I thought this would be the one I would go with for my toddler son to use as a natural mosquito repellent. While there is a faint orange scent and taste, it is completely overtaken by the icky vitiman smell and taste. I guess there just is no way around that with a B vitamin. They sure tried. I tried too. Tried sneaking it into my son's juice, but he quickly caught on. So, ask me where the bottle is now. Collecting dust on the shelf."
negative,Enormously large and heavy,"This is an adapter that comes with Sony F series laptops.It is enormously large -- the volume and weight of half a small netbook. Twice as big as a Thinkpad T60 adapter and 3 times as big as Asus UV30 one. We're not talking little percentage points.If you never move your laptop, this shouldn't bother you, but if you intend to carry it, the adapter will make its enormous gigantic presence noticeable. At least you won't be able forget it easily.If it was a power adapter for a laundry machine, it'd be great, but for a laptop... not so much."
negative,What happened?,"I thought the CD was very repetitive. I'm a very very big Metallica fan and couldn't believe what I was hearing. It sounds as if they were going towards a harder heavier metal but just couldn't reach it. I'm lost for words. There's some interesting songs in here, but I love their old stuff and wish they'd go back to their roots. If you like Metallica go ahead and buy it. You may or may not like it. But I wasn't impressed. Next CD needs to be better."
positive,Pink Floyd Never Ceases To Amaze...,"I am what you might call a ""intermediate"" Pink Floyd fan. I have been exposed to a lot of their work, but have only recently experienced the musical journey that is ""Meddle"". If you have any history with Pink Floyd, this album will render you nearly motionless in delight. But the real beauty of this album, lies in its ability to appeal to even the casual listener. That is of course, with the exception of ""Echoes"", which remains the finest musical emulation of an acid trip to date. Personally, I make time (about 23 minutes) every week to rediscover the depth-of-thought, and utter madness that is ""Echoes"". The album is worth every cent. But more over, ""Meddle"" is worthy of your time, and intellectual consideration."
negative,A French Country Murder,"A book in desperate need of an editor! In the end it lost me and I tried, I really tried. The plot started with the central character falling out with a colleague in the CIA. {Possible, not a problem there} And in despair he lands at Charles de Gaulle Airport north of Paris and from there walks to Spain and half way back again. The Author might have done his case some good if he had actually visited CDG or Paris. I do believe he visited the Village in the Loire, but Mr Steiner France isnt that small. Paris to San Sebastien on foot is considerably further than Chicago to Jackson Mississippi! If you want a good detective story with the flavour and aromas of France, tuck into the Bruno series by Martin Walker, or The Adamsberg series by Fred Vargas, [who is French but well translated into English]."
positive,Love,We love Mercer Meyer around this house and this was just a great book to add to our collection. Wish we could have found a new copy.
negative,"smelled good, but...","The green tea scent was nice, but this didn't do anything to prevent or reduce my razor bumps along my bikini line. Also, it's like a conditioner, so I felt like it left a residue on my skin."
positive,Tunes to blast all summer long & into the rest of the year,"This band knows how to deliver rock & roll with the kind of drumbeat, tantilizing guitar riffs and solid bass while not over-powering the deep, gritty vocals that will thunder from yourspeakers. There are slower more acoustic moments on this cd butBNS comes back with another onslaught of heavy, old style metalthat they have cultivated from the bands that have influencedthem. No-they are not copying styles but using their own musicand lyrics to pay tribute to the great rockers who have proceeded them. Get your copy and you'll love each track. As alistener you'll even be able to find people in your own life thatthese musician's are speaking about. Once you own the cd you'llneed to see a live show to understand what many of us already know. This is 'Your New Favorite Band!'"
positive,This is a Must Read...,"If you are reading this review, you have likely embarked on a deep spiritual journey, as I have.Reading Oneness confirmed and explained all the knowing I already possessed.This is my absolute favorite book and truth to date.I also highly recommend visiting Oneness Through Rasha on Facebook for great quotes from the book with beautiful pictures.All the best on your spiritual journey and I wish you love and peace."
negative,Principal Texes,The book is too general. Doesnt give you any hints or facts. I found very useful other materials. The author is very kind but not important information will be found in this text.
negative,Fell apart before he even wore it,Bought this for my son's 9th birthday because he loves race cars. The lower right button fell off while we were setting it. He hadn't even worn it! Short pins used to connect to base wouldn't stay when we tried to repair it
negative,So bad it's silly,"Their is a very good reason this band is not in the Rock and Roll hall of fame: They are not good. The guitar solos are basic, the music itself is simplistic, and the lyrics, my god the lyrics. I've never heard sillier trash. Just listen to ""The Magician's Birthday"". ""I have a sword of hate,"" ""My answer is simply, an impenetrable fortress of love."" Puhleeez. This band is the epitome of bad 70s art rock. They were trying to be deep and artistic. They failed."
positive,Mirage OMNI S8,"I own Mirage products prior to purchasing the OMNI S8 so I knew the quality of the product already. When I found this deal, I couldn't pass it up. It arrive on time and in a well protected box. I was very concerned in its condition when delivered, and was glad to find the product in perfect working condition."
positive,I'm Jack The Pumpkin King !,"NECA Tim Burtons The nightmare before christmas series 1 jack is just amazing collectiable this figure's price just getting higher and higher lucky for me I found an amazing deal so this figure has 4 acessories two jack o lantern's, zero and evil pumpkin present. just to warn you NECA's Nightmare Before Christmas jack is very fragile figure cause how thin he is so be very careful I havent had problems with this figure at all I actually had this figure attempt suicide not actually but I'm just really thankful it didnt break cause I would be very ticked off if it did. I'm a huge Tim Burton fan I currently own Coraline with shinning star outfit, the mayor, Dr. finlestein, oogie boogie man and sally but I do tend to get other nightmare before chirstmas characters and all stand very well especially this Jack skellington even though it tryed to jump off one time, any way if you love Nightmare before christmas get this figure."
negative,Very Disappointing,"Maybe I expect too much and I know I'm old fashioned, but I like romance and characters that are developed. I like a story where characters discover feelings for one another and I as a reader am taken on a journey with them to figure those feelings out. Sandra Kitt knows how to do this. We've all for the most part have been attracted to someone at first sight, but give me a break. There is a difference between romance and erotica. These characters just annoyed me and I didn't care if they got together or not. ""At Last"" was a little better. One reviewer was right, I too found myself more interested in what was going on with Caroline and Brian then Tracy and Jack. The one good thing I can say about ""Caught Up in the Rapture"" is that I love it's book cover."
positive,"The Grip! surprising album, my review from Barcelona","What a wonderful surprise this GREG KOCH's CD. `The Grip' is not a typical Blues album. It includes several styles but it sure is a terrific guitar exhibition from beginning to end. It's been a long time since I heard such an amazing first track: ""Zoiks"", brilliant. ""Spank It"" is phenomenal; the slow Blues ""Chef's Blues"" is enthralling; there are very good tributes to Jimmy Hendrix in ""Spanish Castle Magic"" and ""Big Jim""; to Eric Clapton in ""Steppin' Out""; and to Albert King in ""Albert's Back""; heavenly sound in ""Drawn My Number""; a little of high level hard Blues in ""The Grip"" and so on. In a few words, a very entertaining and interesting record. I recommend it and I give it 4,5 stars."
positive,Love this tea!,I drink several cups a day to help with digestion. I never get tired of the flavor - has a good ginger bite to it.
positive,Webster's New Word Student's Dictionary,"This dictionary will be appropriate for students in middle and high school. Even in the age of computers and Spell Check, dictionaries are indispensable. This one is a dandy."
negative,the texas chainsaw massacure 2,"this movie I would have to say was pretty bad. There's a lot of action scenes, and blood scenes, but overall this movies sucked ass. To tell you straight out why it sucked was because it's a predictable story and leatherface looks like he got f$%#@@ in the face. You would of thought that maybe because Tobe hooper made the first one this would be good,(also he directed this one too). So rent if you want but don't waste your time hoping for a good movie to come out of this."
positive,Must Have,For Harry Potter Fans a complete pack of the games to date...i loved playing them and can't wait for HP4 game to arrive
positive,Great!,The ball mount worked great. I got it in red and it looks good with a chrome ball. The red one had the best price at the time so its the one I got. Its a great hitch!
negative,Bait and switch,Do not recomend this vender item advertised in stock then they said they wanted to sustitute due to non stock sounds like a bait and switch to me
positive,4th Set - Excellent Product,"I've put these VentShade deflectors on 4 different vehicles now, trucks and cars. Each time, the fit is perfect, they adhere like they are bolted on and really work nicely to allow an open window even when it is raining. I had a set on my F150 for six years and when I sold the truck, they were still like new. I highly recommend this product."
positive,Quite satisfied,"I currently have three of these in use, each one in a separate bluebird house. They provide quality video and sounds. I can even hear people talking when in the yard in the vicinity of the birdhouse. It is very entertaining to watch the birds build their nest, hatch their eggs and raise their young ones."
positive,THESE are STEEL TIP DARTS,"These are excellent darts, but BEWARE they are STEEL TIPS. When I bought my Soft tip dartboard they can up as a related product and since nowhere in the ad did they say steel tip I thought they were soft tip...."
positive,AMAZING,"I have gotten multiple of this product and it never ceases to amaze me! I was considering getting the hydrowhey from the same company but I realized from other reviews that its basically the same and the scoop is bigger so actually when they say it has more protein, it actually dosen't... it has just a little more protein per serving but not too much more! I'd rather get this one its cheaper and I can drink more scoops and it'll last longer for me. I got mocha cappuchino and the taste blew me away! With milk it tasted just like a mcdonalds iced cappuchino! Amazing product!"
negative,Beware of mapping updates,"I just tried to put the 2009 City Navigator North America NT map into this GPSr. It will not show water features after the update. Garmin has told me that this is a problem with this unit. They are reimbursing me the price of the map update because I can't use it for finding streams, lakes, and rivers. If all you want to do is put in an address and go, that's fine. It's been a great GPSr for me and has taken me places I didn't even know exist. Just remember that you may not be able to see the water features on the map, depending on your location. And you may not be able to pinpoint your favorite fishing hole because it won't show up - all all. I'm putting the old 2008 map back in so I can use it for finding water features.For the price of this unit, you can get a new one and not go through the headache of using outdated maps for the rest of the time you use it."
positive,Love the designs but enlarging patterns gets expensive,Love the book and projects but it cost me $8 to enlarge one pattern at Kinkos...next time I will try to fit 2 or 3 more on the same copy
positive,Good Product,"I am definitely feeling the affects of this product, I caution everyone to be careful before detoxing, because this product will do just that, the process is not pretty but it's all worth it to have a clean system. There will be detox symptoms that will eventually pass, with that said I plan on being a repeat customer."
negative,Not that impressed.,"I like Stewart's show but not this book. I didn't even finish it which is a rarity for me. The best comparison I can make is to a juiced-up ""Mad Magazine"" and I outgrew those years ago.Pretty inane."
negative,True love . . .,"True love does not seek to manipulate, exploit or possess the will of the other -- no matter the context, no matter the circumstances, true love will RESPECT the will of the other and grant their freedom. The essential condition for love is respect for the inherent freedom of the other.Keep this in mind as you watch Paulie's psychological self-implosion and disintegration -- ask yourself if she is somebody to be commended, especially in the latter half of the film when she seeks by any means necessary to possess the will of her beloved.(A second viewing may be necessary to see this point)."
negative,Preying on the Fears of Latina Women,"Another self-serving book by another financial planner prowling for customers--but claiming that she is trying to help others. As a Latina woman I am ashamed that Miss Stav would be preying on the fears and financial problems of our own people. The advice isn't new or well written and it won't show you the way to financial freedom. ONLY THE AUTHOR WILL GET RICH FROM THIS BOOK!! Many better books are on the market that contain more useful advice for all women, such as ""Making the Most of Your Money"" by Jane Bryant Quinn and ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias."
negative,Not worth the effort,"I've read most of Toni Morrison's work and anticipated the release of Paradise. I should learn not to set myself up like that. More complex and enigmatic than any of her other novels, Paradise waits far too long before giving the reader enough frame of reference to appreciate what's going on. The characters are interesting, but lack the multi-faceted quality that made books like ""Beloved"" and ""Song of Solomon"" so rich. There is merit to this book, I just didn't find that merit to be worth the effort of slogging through the murky depths of the convoluted storyline."
negative,Don't Turn Around,"MMMMM, yeah baby, this is some serious love making music! Too bad I can't stand love or making it. Luther may have had one hit in the 70s, but this thing has no hits. If you like guys who sound like Tina Turner, you may dig this. I wish Ike would have beat Luther Ingram."
negative,cheap subtitled movie,"this dvd did not meet the quality of other dvd's purchased. the sound quality was poor,at best. Unclear and did not match the characters lined"
positive,Actually Quite Good!!!,"Not as good or as mind blowing as the original, but way better than Reloaded. There is more action in this film than the first two combined. The ceiling shootout at the Club Hell, the 20 minute epic battle against the machines, and of course Neo's final rain-soaked confrontation with Agent Smith are great and worth admission price alone. If you were dissappointed with Reloaded, don't give up hope just yet. Revolutions is why we action fans go to the movies!"
negative,Super disappointing,"Like many of you, I'm a big Savage Garden fan. But please don't force yourselves to like Darren because of that.The title track ""Insatiable"" is good, but the rest of them [stink]. My advice:just buy the single! Darren can't have the chemistry just by himself without Daniel. After all,I mean the whole is more than its sum in Savage Garden."
positive,Flippin' Hilarious!,"Okay, so maybe I'm easily entertained, but this is still super funny every time I read it. I even laugh out loud when I watch other people read it. I originally bought the book because ""Dogzilla"" looks EXACTLY like my dog. He's full of attitude, so I usually get the response ""Oh, so THAT'S where Toby came from!"" I LOVE this book."
positive,Excellent Hooks,We attached the hook to our bathroom door to hang our towels and it does the job. I was pleasantly surprised to see the weight it can handle - excellent product.
positive,"Profoundly moving, changed my life.","This book takes you on a journey. Through its poetic, inspiring words, the reader will find himself transported to another level... a realm beyond the ordinary. Combining photographs and philosophy, Bond compels his listeners to realize just how precarious our contemporary world, beleaguered with technological paraphernalia, is on the verge of destroying our capacity for intimacy."
negative,bad size,"the size is really bad, i ordered 4XL but it came bigger than what i imagined and it's very tall too!The fabric looks good... but didn't actually tried it since it's too big for me..."
positive,An Interesting Look into a Military Mind,"You have to be determined to finish this book. It starts slow, and the writing isn't the best, but it provides an interesting glimpse into the mind of Tommy Franks and the military during the Iraqi and Afghani invasions. I enjoyed it, and it's a great read for anyone interesting in the strategy behind our two latest wars."
positive,MISSION IMPOSSIBLE COMPLETE SERIES,"I want to thank you for offering this series, it made my son, who is 51 yrs old, very happy at Christmas. It is of very good quality and I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed this television show when it was being shown in prime time.Again, thank you for having this complete series for all to enjoyDianne Bird"
positive,Quick introduction to Bali and Java; very current,"This recent travelogue for Bali and (largely central) Java paints a very good portrait. It's a quick read, but still manages to immerse the reader in the areas covered. The book consists of short anecdotal scenes, each describing a specific encounter in such a way that you feel you were there."
positive,If you're into vampire and romance you should read this book,"You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible."
positive,A decent product,"The Black & Decker D2030 has shown itself to be the best iron we've owned. Lots of steam, supported by a large water reservoir.Why then only 4 stars? Because I am skeptical about a product produced by a company that can't answer a simple question about the design of their product. I inspected the iron on receipt and noted that only half the steam holes in the sole plate appear to be functional as they are the only ones that pass fully through the soleplate. I contacted the Black & Decker help line and asked ""How many functional steam holes is the D2030 designed to contain?"" Their response ... ""We don't have that information.""My concern re. the number of functional steam holes is to assure myself that the iron's steam function will work correctly.If they can't answer this question why should I believe they are capable of producing a quality item"
negative,No respect for victims,"Told from the point of view of Ted Bundy, this film is no holds barred, it provides some quite sickening details of the killer's actions with no explanation of what drove the man. I do wonder about the families of the victims. The victims were portrayed as one-dimensional walk-on parts. I know this is how Bundy would have seen them, as meat and nothing more, but I found it disrespectful to those who died and who were left to grieve. It is clear that the director has no idea of the enormity of these crimes and the affect on the victums' families, if he did he might have thought twice. I suppose he felt the execution scene would create a balance, but it doesn't. These were real people, not inventions, by showing us this the film would have been that much more powerful and convincing."
positive,collection available for other dvd regions,"As a big fan of Jane Austen, this collection is undoubtedly precious and i would be delighted to hear soon that it will be available also for other dvd regions beside USA and Canada."
negative,The Street Lawyer is one big snooze,"I was so disappointed in this latest Grisham book. I kept expecting things to get interesting and mysterious but all I got was hundreds of pages of social commentary. I read Grisham for escapism, not morality harangues. The plight of the poor and homeless in this country is an abomination, but, I don't think that a novel is the best place for advocacy. Mr. Grisham needs to put his show on the road and raise money for the homeless and get back to writing the books where the pages practically turn themselves."
positive,300 HD,"I bought this item as a gift. I had a hard time finding the HD version in stores, so was very pleased to get it so quickly on Amazon. Great quality, quick delivery."
positive,Extremely useful internet book.,Lots of interesting facts I never knew about the internet. Made my internet experience a lot more enjoyable and productive than I ever imagined!
negative,A classic I think not!,"The Tomb Of The Cybermen is regarded as one of the very best Doctor Whos there are, but when I saw it, I was amazed at how bad it was. The main problem is that the whole story is layered on three sets - two rooms, and the tomb. Them aside, the story goes virtually nowhere. For some reason, the Cybermen do duck impressions all the time. The cast are predictably bad (especially the ""american"" captain) and the plot is quite silly..."
positive,They'll do the job. Sturdy enough,"They're about as basic a rubber boot as I can think of, but definitely the cheapest I could find and they are thick. I at least don't imagine them wearing out or forming a hole any time soon. I read someone else's review about them being flimsy. I bought them anticipating this, but mine are pretty sturdy. Perhaps they bend a bit. I definitely would order one size smaller than daily shoes. I wear shoe size 11 and the 10's are nearly right on... maybe could have even ordered a 9.5 had they'd been offered."
negative,"Very poor game, I expected more but received less.","I loved Dead or Alive for the regular Xbox. However, this game is just a piece of garbage. First of all, this might not be a big deal to most people, but if you love to earn achievements, YOU WILL hate the achievements for this game. I cannot begin to explain how hard this game is. Yes it is fun to watch these beautiful characters dance around but there is NO nudity in this game. I was very sad with my purchase because personnaly, I thought this game had nudity. But there is none. There are no instructions for when you start the game, possibly your only option is to research the game online and watch youtube videos how people play the certain types of games in DOAX2. I have to tell you all, the racing games this DOAX2 has to offer are very challenging. You will waste your money if you purchase this product."
negative,Not worth buying,"This rug has a very thin weave and looks cheap. Also the ""white"" background in the photo is more of a dirty off-white color."
negative,A Sad Gift,"This movie doesn't stand the test of time - if it weren't for the concert footage, it would be virtually unwatchable.I was hugely into Jane's Addiction back in the olden days, and their music is still perhaps the most important creative achievement in alt rock. ""Nevermind"" never would have happened without ""Nothing's Shocking.""But the story part of this movie is just a drug-addled, self-indulgent load of tripe. I'd much rather see all the performances together and then have the option of watching the mistakenly artsy story scenes.I'll still listen to their first three albums religiously, but I won't ever open this Gift again."
positive,Blood Brother,"If you find yourself still interested in the case of Laci Peterson, then this book is for you. It takes you on a journey through the life and death of Laci Peterson through the overlooked point of view of Laci's sister-in-law, Anne Bird. It is a fascinating and thought-provoking book, but no matter how many books are written on this subject nothing will ever change the disheartening ending that Laci Peterson will not get to have the child she had so joyfully looked forward to raising."
negative,Not Worth it!,"I didn't enjoyed this at all, sorry to say! But I also purchased Theological immortal romance, which I can suggest. Which was a wonderful, uplifting, spiritual and romantic experience."
negative,Travel Book? What A Joke!!!!!,"Because of making a quick decision to travel to Papua New Guinea, I ordered the Lonely Planet Papua New Guinea Book from you and payed to have it ovenighted.Although I wasn't leaving until 5 days later, the book never arrived.Upon returning from the trip, I found the book had arrived while I was gone. Although asking for overnight shipping, it had been shipped 4 days after the order date,and by ground. But the best part of it was that the book was the 1993 version!!!! An information travel book 17 years old! I don't know if I should call it a joke or just the total rip off that it is.Will I use your services again? I'm not so stupid!Anthony FalconeKey West, Florida"
negative,MOTOv300,"OK moto 300 not a bad phone, most problems with the phone is mostly with user error and abuse...v330 is better v360 is coming!"
positive,DECEITFUL,OK. OOOOPS! MY ERROR. I. didn't look close enough at the small print. This indeed is Burt Lancaster's first film. If anyone looked at my first review. please ignore.
positive,"wonderful film, true to the book",I thoroughly enjoyed this video. It remains very true to the book. I was becoming rather tired of films straying so far from burnetts story. The film kept me enthralled from beginning to end. I have watched it several times and shown it to all my friends and they agree that it is a magical story. A must see!
negative,Why is Amazon supporting bootlegs??,"This is a bootleg, pure and simple. The quality is sub standard, there are little to none special features. There is a real version with dolby sound on Amazon, get the real one, support anime."
negative,Warning ! This is not the original sound track !!,"Bear in mind this is not the original Pink Panther sound track, even though they deceptively make it look as if it is. I purchased this CD specifically for the number Claudia Cardinale sings, but to my great disappointment her song is not included and they substitute the corny instrumental in it's place. I feel cheated, and believe they should make it clear that this CD may not contain the tracks one may be looking for..."
positive,Thank You For the Music,"Even if you did not see the Broadway Production, the soundtrack to Mama Mia! by The Universal Music Company will keep you rocking through the night with some of ABBA's greatest hits of the 70's. Some of the songs featured on this soundtrack are Mama Mia, Dancing Queen, Super Trouper, Chiquitita, and 20 other great hits. No matter what year you were born, these upbeat songs will for sure keep you happy and will help you to be cheerful on a busy day."
negative,If You Buy This...,"I can't believe she actually published personal, private poems A.J. wrote to her, and photos of A.J. and the rest of the Boys. The first thing that caught my eye was a notice, stating that A.J. McLean or any of the other Backstreet Boys had nothing to do with this book and did not agree to it. (Unauthorized, in other words.) If you really do love the Backstreet Boys, especially A.J., don't buy this book!"
negative,Diminishing,"Let's stop the series here, it's slow paced, uneventful, anti climatic. Maybe one third of the previous ones"
negative,Very disappointing,"I will not recommend anyone to spend money to buy it for their library. I was disappointed. The story moved too quickly for my liking. To have real hold of story on readers mind, the author should grasp him by establishing a strong profile of the characters whereas in this story ...... there was a woman and we don't know anything about her except that she came from seatle and withing few days she was ready to live with someone she didn't know anything about .... and get that ... she made up her mind to marry him when she looked at him first time .... Love at first sight . and then there was this indian cheif who knew that the woman he just saw was his destiny and she can replace his wife ..... ..... HmmmmGood but wasted plot of the story."
negative,Not strong enough,"Every bowl I try to make on this ends up smashing on the floor, no matter how much I tighten it, and how careful I turn."
negative,same thing new story,I like shorts don't get me wrong! these one's just didn't do it! it was still worth the rental! if your bored!
positive,Good product,"This product works very well and is simple to use as long as you follow the directions. I like the privacy it gives while still letting light through. It's great too because you can take it off, move it, cut it and reuse it."
negative,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy","I bought this item based on the reviews and the fact that my two cordless drills both had their batteries go belly up because they only get used sporadically - so the alkaline power source seemed a good fit. My first, and only, project with this screwdriver was replacing the magnetron on my microwave - all it had to do was unscrew about 25 sheetmetal screws and then replace them. No major torque jobs or anything, but by the end of the project the screwdriver was out of power and wouldn't tighten the screws even snug. It's handy to have around if all you need to do is remove faceplate covers from your switches and wall plugs, save you from having to do it manually, but doesn't have any power or stamina. I can't imagine somebody trying to use this product for woodscrews."
negative,Superstitious horse manure,More superstitious horse manure from a con artist who plays on people's fears to make a pile of money.
negative,Don't waste your money.,"We bought seven of these and none worked, neither the thermometer or the humidity gauge."
negative,People Liked This Movie?,"I actually sat through the entire movie waiting for something to happen - it didn't. This is one of those movies that the artsy fartsy set really like, maybe because there is a vertically-challenged gentleman in it. Who knows. For those of you who like movies with real plots and things like that, look elsewhere. This is one of those movies that feels like it was done by your brother in some film school project and really isn't much of a movie. I love trains, so at least there were trains, but other than that, I can't get my two hours back from sitting through this."
positive,Difficult material but worthwhile,This is one of those books of which you either like it or not. Maybe is not an option. Great book overall!
negative,Stuck Pixels and uneven backlighting,"I know that for the price paid for the item, that I shouldn't expect miracles, but seriously... 2 stuck pixels and the uneven backlighting on this monitor are completely crappy. It doesn't even produce that great an image over DVI. I have yet to get fed up and switch it to see if it works any better on an analog connection, so if I ever do it, I'll update my review.I have a viewsonic Q20wb which I use at work and it's flawless...beautiful backlighting for great black-level performance, no stuck pixels, and great color calibration.The Acer just doesn't live up to the hype... Spend 20-30 bucks more for something better."
positive,Very good but not great.,"We got this double stroller because our girls were 14 mo. apart. Even though our oldest walks well now, we still use this when we are out for long walks or shopping so as to keep her closer to us.Pros: The car seat that came with the single child travel system works with this stroller too. Car seat can go in either the front or the back.Durable.Drives easily, rides smoothly.Cons: Difficult to collapse and open again. The wheels have to line up perfectly(!) with the frame so that the locking mechanism can catch. Also, the catch is so tight it's hard to unlock it in order to open the stroller again.Somewhat heavy to get in and out of the SUV.Bulky - Fits fine in our SUV, but in a car it has to be put in the trunk upside down so the trunk lid shuts. The problem with this is 1) stuff falls out of the basket; and 2) I don't like the parts my girls touch to be on the bottom of the dirty trunk.I'd get one again though. Once it's open it's a dream."
positive,"Dark, ominous, delicious.","I listened to the album for the first time through on headphones this morning and it sounded to me like the last songs of a Hallowe'en dance at a high school in the 1980's -- leaves swirling in the dusk and a half-smoked, hastily-discarded cigarette smouldering in the garbage bin in the girl's washroom. Uneasy -- the potential for something bad to happen."
negative,Pure hysterics..... so what if there is no gold.,"So what if there is no gold in Knox? The U.S. has been off the gold standard for decades. This film is so sensationalistic and overblown with weird soundtrack and 3 people who are described as simply attorney, professor and engineer. How lame. Just pure yellow journalism, film to make a buck... and not an ounce of gold to see either."
negative,Price Gouged,"I had no trouble opening this pillbox, but once I did I had two surprises. First, it was not polished on the inside. And worse, it had a price sticker on it marked $7.90. Deeper and better made is the Frank Lloyd Wirght pillbox for the same price I found on Amazon. Although not sterling silver it is much nicer and appropriately priced."
negative,Old book Copyright in 1977,"Didn't realize I was ordering a book that was thirty six years old, and it was rated ""good"". The cover was torn and it was all faded. Haven't read it yet, so it might be really wonderful."
positive,Worth the money,"I enjoyed this book very much. Has great ideas and is written to make everything understandable.Includes recipes! Havent tried any yet, but many sound very good!"
positive,Insurance for your lens,"I wish I didn't need this - works like it's supposed to: keeps sun, fingers, and everything else away from the lens glass. It seems a ridiculous price to pay for plastic, but a bargain for the peace of mind I guess."
negative,The paper was different,"I have this product, but when I purchased this notebook from your company, the paper was a differentshade of orchid. It was not the same shade. But, I will say, that I might have not purchased from youwhen I brought this product 6 months ago."
positive,Moms review for 9 year old,"I was skeptical about this because of the recommended age. My husband insisted we get this one (the bigger one). My son has never ridden a dirt bike and he took to this like a fish to water. We have had no issues and it works great. I would say this is perfect for his age/size. The battery life has been fine, went together easily and hopefully will be working fine for a long time. It was such a huge hit with our son."
positive,Learning to move on,"Frances Brooklyn has just lost her beloved husband Stephen to a heart attack, and she is adrift in the world trying to cope. Her sister-in-law Zoe, her niece Tabitha, and her adopted son Henry are all there for her, but Stephen - the memory of Stephen - consumes her. Near the end she meets a nice man named Morris, which just might develop into something, but more importantly Frances no longer has the need to dwell in the past. The future beckons. A quietly captivating, well-written novel."
negative,Tampered? But works like new.,"850MAH LI-ION BATTERYI just got a '850MAH LI-ION BATTERY' BL-5C Nokia battery from:Shipper and seller 'SF Planet'AKA'CCMAccessories'AKA'Malcom Distributors'I have just received the battery and have it charging. I am unaware of how it will perform but will return when I am.This note is to point out that this product seems to be an official Nokia product with an official Nokia hologram sticker. The only worrying issue is that the 'serial type' number on the hologram has been marked over. I don't know what this means but it doesnt seem right.________________________________________Oct 8 2008Okay I'm upgrading my rating to four star. I charged the new out of-the-box battery on Sunday, ran it Monday, Tuesday and today Wednesday until it died at 4pm. To me that's good, that the way a new Nokia battery should act.It looses one star for the dodgy logo number cover-up which I rubbed off.My Nokia 6230 is happy and so am I."
positive,Essential for climbers,"Every climber alive should read ""Accidents"" every year, because it's the best way to learn what you should not do. (For all other climbers, it's too late.) It also makes you aware how easy it is for one tiny slip to become dangerous or fatal, and when those slips are most likely to happen. Besides, it satisfies the morbid curiosity most of us have about other people's accidents at the same time that it serves an educational purpose. Whats not to love about a book like that?"
positive,An answer to years of searching!,"I was made aware of Dr. Orloff through a website link, I immediately felt a connection to what she was stating. I found Second Sight to be personal and informative. I really liked the way the book is divided into sections, the first half on her life and the second on ways to use your intuition. After years of wondering if things I felt and sensed were normal,SecondSight provided the answers I was unable to find anywhere else. The book also gives specific exercises to use to further develop your skills. A great book for anyone who wants to learn more about Intuition, Dreams and Healing yourself."
positive,"Good, but not heavy-duty.","I bought this particular brand because of the name and the appearance of the sample picture. It looked like a good heavy duty cable that justified 2x the price of a cheap cable. What I got is just a cheap cable. It works, but it's no better than the no-name brand cables at half this price."
positive,Great G-Gauge Battery Operated Train,"My son, a toddler, loved watching the previous EZ Track Christmas train run around the base of our Christmas Tree. However, the noise from the EZ Track train became unbearable with the constant use. We landed on the Polar Express Lionel G-Gauge as a replacement. He loves watching it just the same, and it runs so much quieter. Highly recommend ordering the 9V rechargeable batteries, as it tends to run through the C batteries very quickly. It also, runs a lot faster on the 9V."
positive,wonderful.,"After readingTen Thousand Miles by Freight Train: A Memoir of Beauty and Freedom on the Rails, I was looking for more writing by poet-philosophers on wild adventures; this book fit the bill quite nicely. Vicarious adventure and deep thoughts, nature and zen; a wonderful combination of which I will never tire."
negative,bottarga di muggine,"The quality of this product is very bad - it is very very dry and it looks like it is too old already. I understand that it is genuine and original and really comes from Sardegna, however the Bottarga product, that I usually buy there is much better tasting and a way better looking."
positive,It is too for kids!,"My husband and I have been Pratchett fans for years, and never thought we'd be able to share a Pratchett book with our two-year old daughter for many more years. Hah! She loves this book. We have to read it twice before she goes to bed, and if we try to substitute something else, she says firmly, ""Cow! Cow!""This is an honest testimonial - give your kids a chance to enjoy this book!"
positive,One of the best books on Understanding basics of OOP,"I think at introductory level, it is the best book to understand basics of OOP and JAVA. It seems as if Author has written whole book in one sitting. There is such a flow in writing of sections of book that you are tempted to read more and more like a suspense novel."
positive,No Motiv doesn't let me down.,"Fantastic buy, you'll enjoy it. The first two tracks come from No Motiv's upcoming album Daylight Breaking and they are fantastic! The vocals are a lot stronger sounding than the previous album, yet Jeremy still keeps that crooning in his voice. Instrumentally, this rocks. The third track sounds kind of like it came from Diagram for Healing, but that's okay because that was a fantastic album. Track 4 ""Keep It Going"" is one of those songs that proves that slow songs can still be fantastic. Awesome backups near the end. Definitely buy! Oh yeah, No Motiv still shines with their fantastic packaging."
negative,Exercises in Ultrasonography,"I have to say that I thought this book would have more review questions in each chapter. Once you get passed chapter 1, you may get 15 to 20 review questions. I had hope to see more questions. The author failed to give an explanation to the questions and answers. Each chapter starts off with review questions. I would have expected to have read about the subjects before seeing the review questions.In the instructions for students the author says ""Pay attention to the key words and objectives"". Well I was certainly dispointed because I did not see any key words and objectives.The book contains unlabeled images and illustrations for every chapter but it failed to identify and describe the parts of the anatomy in the image. They leave up to you to figure out the parts of the image.I am certainly disappointed.MCP"
negative,First stories were great but I wound up wishing I hadn't bought the book.,"Some excellent stories near the beginning of the book, but there was creepy/questionablecontent toward the end of the book that I guess we were supposed to think was funny?I was left wishing I hadn't bought the book and would not buy from this writer again."
negative,suction dish,"It does not stick to high chair tray, my grandson could pull it off and all the food went on the floor."
positive,effective,i love this product. Its very helpful and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer. Thank you
negative,Beaches of the Big Island,"This book displays black and white pictures and is totally outdated. Out of all the tour books on Hawaii that I ordered (Frommers 2000, Fodors 2000, Best Places to Stay in Hawaii and the guides books written by Andrew Doughty and Harriet Friedman, Lonely Planet) this was by far the worst. I should have returned it while I could but I wanted to give it a chance. What a waste of time and money."
negative,"Title is misleading; 13"" x 10"" is not square. where did they go to school?","Title is misleading; 13"" x 10"" is not square. where did they go to school?"
negative,Alot of interference,"Terrible, Receives radio stations through headsets even with transmitter off and back inside packaging. When it was transmitting the sound was very garbled and line of sight ended at 3 feet."
positive,DELIGHTFUL,THIS IS WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT A FUN BIRTHDAY PARTY. IT FEATURES CHARACTERS FROM OTHER BOOKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR. MY PRESCHOOL STUDENTS LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!
negative,'tis unfortunate,"'Tis unfortunate that many of the people in Ms. O'Hara's book are not alive--thus unable to either dispute or to prove a good number of her assertions. Although much of the biography does evoke the era of ""contract players Hollywood,"" much does have a false or hollow ring. For a woman who seemed very determined and ""aware,"" being trapped in a horrible, abusive marriage for so long seems a bit far-fetched! Also, from what I've read in the past, Gertrude Lawrence had ALWAYS been set for The King and I!!! Maybe one day, we'll get an O'Hara film bio-pic starring Marni Nixon!!!"
positive,Best Car Seat on the Market!,I spent a great deal of time trying to find the perfect car seat for my ten pound shih tzu. THIS IS IT! She loved it from the moment I put her in it. It is a great size for her to look out the window and later curl up in for a nap. The dynamics and quality of design are exceptional. No straps for her to have to look through or get caught in...and the ability to vary the height is very helpful. I must admit when she is not with me the seat makes a great place to put papers and my purse! Your dog will love you for getting this item!
positive,Great product,Great product for the price. I signed up for the Amazon rewards card and basicly got it for free. I love it.
negative,Hands stick and clock stops,"Disappointing because hands on the clock face occasionally catch on each other and then the time stops. Second hand keeps sticking on the minute hand and requires a gentle tap for the time to start again. Useless if the time is not accurate. Thought it might be a fluke, but it's happened at least five times now."
negative,Wasn't comfortable on my Canon 7D,"I don't care for neck straps, so this seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, it wasn't comfortable once installed. It was fine for just holding the camera, but it made taking pictures difficult."
negative,Simply Disappointing,"They have not done it again, I am a salsa collector and know good music when i hear it. This cd is very poor in musical arrangments and singing with the exception of pete pagan. I bought this cd because i read a positive review on this item, but it seems like the reviewer does not know what hard core salsa is all about. Will not make that mistake again From a 1 to 10 i rate this cd a 1. Hermanos Moreno has done better i hope they get on the ball and put some real salsa out there."
negative,Disappointed,The quality of this item is less than I expected. I would rather have this music done by well known artists in single CD's. The sound quality is poor at best. Some of the music I have on single CD's ie; Van Cliburn. The 1812 Overture sounds like a studio recording instead of cannons going off it sounds like a studio sound effect. In the future I will elect to buy Single recordings. (Please note: I have a box set of Beethoven 9 symphony's that is quite good)
positive,Great costume for children!,"My son wore this costume for his first Halloween (see the customer image picture I posted above) and just loved it. Spider-Man is his favorite super hero and he barely could contain his excitement. The only issue the Mrs. and I found was that the drawstring mask just didn't work. If you have children, you know that infants tend to not take a liking to things around their head and will inevitably take it off. And lest he should try to pull it off the wrong way and choke himself, the Mrs. fastened the mask to a pair of sunglasses that our boy didn't mind. In addition, the costume does not include a pair of red socks which we had to buy separately (why the boy in the main Amazon picture is wearing blue socks is beyond me. I mean c'mon get it right kid!). Besides this the costume was (dare I say it) amazing!Caesar says thumbs up!"
negative,"Should be titled ""How to beat your child to death"" as Pearl's followers have done.","This is an instruction manual on how to beat your child with a belt, pipe, stick, or wire and blame this abuse on god.Several children whose parents followed these horrible teachings, have died.Just do an online search for Sean Paddock, Lydia Schatz, and Hana Williams.After the 2010 death of 7-year-old Lydia Schatz was linked to methods Mr. and Mrs. Pearl espouse, there was a great outcry from non-spankers and spankers alike. Michael Pearl's response to what was largely thoughtful and concerned criticism, was a blog post where he openly laughed at his critics and posted a photo of the kind of plumbing line Lydia Schatz was killed with (the kind of plumbing line he and his wife recommend as a spanking tool on their website). Such insensitivity from a man who claims to be doing the will of God, is disturbing beyond words.SEVERAL CHILDREN HAVE BEEN BEATEN TO DEATH DUE TO THE TEACHINGS OF THIS BOOK. IT'S NOT A JOKE."
negative,Bond is better.,"Mi2 just steals from bond movies,so cliché, pigeons..etc. Seems to me that people who thinks mi2 was original and good action movie, havent seen much films, or they watch only films that are ""hot"".. MI1 was much better.. Woo has surely lost something,imagination."
positive,Dakine Heli-Pack,"This back pack is awesome... I was borrowing my friend for about 2 months now using it for hiking and jogging. I'm a bigger guy 6'-3"" 220lbs and when adjusted properly it fits me just fine; My smaller friends have also used it and the adjust-ability works out perfect now they all are going to buy Heli-Packs now :) Also- we all snowboard & ski living in the PNW, so i will have to wait and see how that works out, I will probably end up buying the camelback style bladder for this bag as well. There is a small pocket on the left shoulder strap that is perfect for mp3 players. Makes for a great gym bag too. Quality is excellent for the price, Just buy it already you wont regret it.Dakine 11-Litre Heli Pack"
positive,Death be not Proud,Hope v.s. Brain TumorThe book Death be not Proud is a story about a 16 year old that was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The story is written from his father's point of view. Johnny was a high- spirited young man that wanted to live life to the fullest. His mother was always there to help him enjoy he fifth teen months in the hospital. Johnny got out of the hospital and said hello and good- bye all his friends in high school before graduating. He was fine for a couple months taking meds and having help. Things got bad when Johnny couldn't remember how to tie his shoes or button up his shirts. Johnny started to feel a lot of pain in his head so they re-admitted him to the closest hospital and he passed away a few days after. All of his life he dreamed of going to Harvard University and if there was anyone that could have taken this away it would have made a difference in his friends and family's life. If you are looking for a touching story read Death be not Proud.
positive,wireless mouse review,"this is my 4th wireless mouse and while it took a bit to get use to by way of grip, it very comfortable to work with .. i love it."
positive,"The best chips ever invented, truly the pinnacle of human acheivement and civilization","Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet. Yes they really are that good.I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented. It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.I also highly recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones."
negative,AWFUL TAPE,I ship alot of items and I can't stand this tape it just won't stick. I've given up with Scotch & gone to another brand that puts it to shame.
positive,"Great smelling ,,,,great feeling cream",I love this product and all Exuviance products..they have a great smell and seem to work well.
positive,fullmetal alchemist,"this dvd includes episode 20-24, you can also watch fullmetal alchemist on adult swim monday-wednesday at 12:30 am. and new episode on saturday at 12.00am. this dvd is awsome!"
negative,It broke,"I used the disher maybe three times. The first couple times were on soft batters for cakes and muffins. The final time was on a batch of chocolate chip cookie dough. It broke like other reviews said it would. I thought it could be fixed but we couldn't manage it. My husband threw it away before I had a chance to return it.Not an overly specific review but its been a few months since it broke, sorry."
negative,It's really pretty bad.,"The writing is unnecessarily ""over-wrought"" and the guy is such a megalomaniac it's shocking. I mean I am no military expert, but I'm shocked that I hadn't heard of this guy before since he basically won the whole war for us."
positive,Good . . .,". . . and as another reviewer notes, this is the only detailed guide to the area. Ruby Jenkins passed away last year, so this 1994 edition is likely to be the last ever. And there have been changes--for example, the 2000 Manter Meadow wildfire destroyed most of the Domeland Wilderness Area, focus of several trips in the book, so readers are advised to avoid Domeland hikes.I have found that members of the Kern River Valley Hiking Club, a group founded by Ruby Jenkins and accessible on a certain website, regularly take trips described in the book and respond to questions about current conditions, obscure directions and the like with good humor."
negative,NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!,"Considering the price, this unit was a real disappointment. Within a short time the ice blue plastic ""topper"" cracked and had to be tossed. The foot bath was not as deep as I was anticipating and as far as the heat and jets they were just so so. Hugely overpriced for the quality of product it is. Better than other foot spas on the market, but not $70-$80 better. If this were priced under$50, it would be worth it in my mind."
negative,NEED TO SAY THERE IS NO LAMP SHADE WITH THIS,NEED TO SAY THERE IS NO LAMP SHADE WITH THISDID NOT FIND ANYWHERE THAT THERE IS NO SHADETHAT SUCKSRICK
negative,Good product bad battery.,"I had no problem with the seller, the product came in good condition without any visable defects.The problem is that the battery didn't work upon arrival, after I replaced the battery (it is not one intended for replacement and I tinker in electronics a bit), The headset work as intended.Because of the nature of the headset the battery is very hard to replace and not intended to be replaced by the average user. So while the product worked as intended after a battery replacement, many customers may get a headset that dosen't work because of this problem."
positive,movie review,"Brings me back to the time I saw the movie as a kid. You can make all the ""Avatar"" movies you want ......... But when the dust clears .......... ""The Magnificent Seven"" is still a must have for your video collection. The Blu Ray has the sound and picture quality of the original movie, as seen in theaters."
negative,Highly disappointed,"When I first heard that Apocalyptica was recording ""Seemann"" I was incredibly excited about it. Now that I was able to hear it for the first time I was sadly disappointed. Apocalyptica does incredibly good, but the voice. Nina Hagen made me cry with her attempt to sing one of my favorite Rammstein songs. As a big fan of Rammstein i must admit that the work done by Apocalyptica is simply amazing. Why couldn't Nina Hagen just shut the hell up!!!???"
positive,"Quality pictures, but heavy material","As many reviews have stated, this is a heavy material that would not work well if one wanted any kind of drape. The picture quality was excellent. I used it to print out old and current pictures of my family for a patchwork quilt that was a big hit. It would also be great for totes and aprons. Although I don't have kids, I could see this as a project they would really enjoy as well."
positive,Great fix-it tool,"Purchased for use around the house and have been very pleased with performance and features. Perfect for home repairs and maintenance, plenty of power for general household use. Compact and convenient as well. Only flaw is directional slide switch is not firm enough and can be moved too easily. I have used for small pilot hole drilling as well with hex-shanked bits - works fine in soft woods and walls etc."
negative,"A religious history of the Scot Irish, not a history of the people","Unless you are really interested in all the petty arguments about religion among the protestant, presbyterians and baptists this book is not for you. Data on the Scots Irish people themselves makes up less than 25% of this book and even then it is more into quoting what this official or that official had to say. You don't really get a feel for what the people were like or why they were the way they were.If you want to understand our ancestors and what drove them, read ""Born Fighting : How the Scots-Irish Shaped America"" by James Webb. Not only does it bring these early settlers to life but tickled my intestests enough to buy more books on the over-mountain people and Andrew Jackson."
negative,not as expected,The cool part of the shirt - which is just a t - is the design. the design is on the back - the front is a small insignia of the hardkor sportswear logo. disappointed.
negative,Pretty bland,"This is a harmless enough little holiday yarn, but that is about it. There is almost no description. A display of holiday lights, for example, is described as ""like those in [Emily's] hometown, but different, too,"" which tells us precisely nothing. I didn't really find any of these people very admirable; as characters they were underdeveloped, and sometimes it was hard to remember (or care) who was who. Nobody contemplates anything very deep. Good things happen, but basically by coincidence. Wait and check this one out at the library, if you must."
positive,They did it RIGHT!!!,"I've been waiting for this set for so long, and I was terrified that it would be some sort of half-assed money grab. And it's NOT!The packaging is good, there's a pamphlet with a couple of short essays about the show and a concise episode guide.I found the extra features, in particular, really interesting. I love the behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's a LOT of it here. The only disappointment was the absence of Matt Frewer. I'm sure he had his reasons for opting out of this, but it would have been nice to have the whole crew in on that round table discussion."
negative,Good only for the beginners.,"This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself."
positive,"If I had my way, I'd have all of you shot","I love ""The Wall,"" both movie and album. The story is very close me, so maybe I'm a bit biased.I've heard people say you'd have to be stoned in order to watch it. I disagree, I understood it perfectly. ""Tommy"" on the other hand...now there was a movie you'd probably have to be stoned in order to enjoy!I give it 4 stars only because the album version of ""Mother"" was better. Plus, the movie doens't have ""Hey You."" (It was filmed, but was cut out of the movie. See it on the DVD and know why)."
negative,Blade Runner Collector's Edition - Final Cut Disc Omission/Lable Error,"I received the 5-disc BR collector's edition set as a 2009 Christmas gift. Disc 1, labeled as ""The Final Cut"" was in fact, the Workprint disc - the Final Cut disc was entirely omitted from the set! Due to numerous reports on Amazon and in other forums, it makes me think that this error must affect thousands of units but only a few of the purchases are returned either due to consumer ignorance or laziness. This same manufacturing error has been reported since the release of the collector's edition and it is still not corrected - I suppose it is cheaper to replace a few discs for those who take the time to complain than to recall the faulty lot of sets with possible errors."
positive,Good reinforcement!,"I listened to Judge Judy's book on audio cassette while walking. I picked it up because my spirits were low and I needed a boost. I don't think this book will change your life but it's entertaining and it helps reinforce some good points that we, as women, need to be reminded of. She helps you accept the inequalities in the work place and gives you tips on how to make the best of it."
positive,Thanks Mom,"My mother bought me this book to read when I was 13. The realistic descriptions of what Alice went through made it so I was not courious to know how drugs would make you feel, I felt I already knew. I thank my mom for this experience because I fell it saved me from one."
negative,Bar Baby is made for Baby Bras,"This is only made for people that wear small cup bras A or B,it is impossible to put even a C cup bra in it."
positive,sumptous reading,"beautifully written tale of a monster-man, an evil genius, inhuman in lacking a scent of his own, superhuman in his olfactory abilites, sumptously rendered for all its grim horror. It only lacks a fifth star because of a narrative flaw, the story fades out in anticlimax like its sinister superhero"
positive,"COLORADO'S BIGGEST BUCKS AND BULLS, Second Edition",I love this book because of all the photos and detailed hunting stories. The book is easy to read because the type is big.
positive,Sati is an ispirational novel!,I was scepticle at first to even read a novel by Christopher Pike becasue he is known young adult hooror stories. But my friend got me to read this and I loved it! It really makes you think about life and all the good things it has to offer. I read this book once a year now. It is one of my favorites. I encourage everyone to read this book one time intheir life.
positive,Epitome of teenage transitions.,"I read this years ago, while I was still in high school, and at that time I could definitely see how young adults would have been able to relate. This book goes into the life of a teenager who has gotten lost somewhere in the transition of Junior High to High School due to an ultimate betrayal. It shows the insecurities and peer pressure that teens feel almost daily. In a way I think this book is about Matilda (the main character) finding her voice, pun intended, and finally being able to come to terms with what she has been through. I think this is a must read for young adults and adults alike."
negative,Not Worth It,Tried to repair a disk with a small stalling problem; Aleratec failed to repair or restore this disk even after numerous tries. Not what it is advertised to do.
negative,Not much help,This book was not much help to me when trying to learn about music of the classical and romantic era. The text is very vague and poorly written
negative,Conventional,"This is pretty conventional music without any harmonic, rhytmic or melodic inventiveness. Good only for background music."
positive,ADORABLE,I really adored this movie entitled MEAN GIRLS. You should read more reviews in an effort to acquire more information about it.
positive,"Excellent, affordable, comprehensive","This book is a must-have for anyone responsible for realistic decision making about his/her ability to provide health care at home, as well as an excellent how-to guide for those who accept the inherent responsibilities of the caregiver. I consider it the one ""best"" guide of those available to meet the needs of the growing number of home caregivers."
negative,Not the one,"I was totally disappointed. This is mostly photage from rehearsals of a new 2007 staging of Hair. Endless casting and rehearsals that are completely unengaging.I was hoping that I had found a documentary of the making of Milos Forman's film, but if this documentary had been done more skilfully it could have been interesting by itself. But the continuity is terrible, and it's just plain sloppy. Perhaps there is material for a 25 minute show in this, but then it is bloated up by nonsense to force it up to a length that can be sold on DVD.If anybody wants to help me: Where can I find the fantastic documentary about the making of Forman's film? It's mindblowingly good, and goes through all the casting of the film and the magic that made it possible to do the film on relatively low budget at just that moment in time. How the right people just seemed to pop out of nowhere, just when they were needed."
positive,It works!,"This is the ONLY product that has stopped my Fox Terrier from chewing on the patio furniture, a little spray on the mornings and that did it! it smells really bad but who cares, as long as my dog doesn't like the smell it works for me!"
negative,"My church has spent thousands removing ""tags"".",Wish you would stop painting on others property. If you want to express your art buy some space and paint away. How would you like it if I made you put on a suit and tie every day? not your style? Well having your tag on the side of my building is not my style so lets keep our styles to our selves and don't forces our selves on others.
negative,Quality was below par,"I liked the movie a lot, but the streaming was choppy, and we didn't receive HD quality for the majority of the movie. Twice we had to stop the movie and go back to the Amazon interface to start to movie over again to get it to play through."
negative,DANGER -- do not buy,"This product is very dangerous! It came apart while slicing an apple, with the ring in hand, and the blades embedded into the apple. I highly recommend anyone who is thinking of buying this slicer find another one instead."
positive,Great Price,"My daughter used these dance shoes for 3 years- all during her high school years. I am so glad that we found them on AMazon. She stil has them ans is taking them to college with her , where she will be dancing as well."
negative,Experts Only!,"This book is essentially a reference text book on Yoga. In that regard, it is totally comprehensive and complete. However, I bought it on a recommendation from an acquaintance who said it was a great book to get started with yoga. It is certainly NOT THAT!!! I am a beginner yoga student and if you are or similar you could hurt yourself trying many of the poses in this book. Further, the book doesn't progress from easy poses to more difficult ones but rather skips from advanced to easy back to advanced, etc. I would NOT recommend this book if you are a beginner or are looking for a simple intro to yoga. Just looking at some of the poses hurt me."
negative,GS Wholesale Rating Manipulation,"It is a very disingenuous practice to write a 5 star ""customer review"" of a product that you are a seller of. Even if it is under the guise of ""Additional Product Info!"", it is still manipulating the rating system at Amazon, since customers sort searches with average customer rating and your products come out on top. Because of your lack of integrity as a seller, I will never buy a GS Wholesale product. I am also going to complain to Amazon about your rating manipulation."
negative,Certainly Not Ludlum,"I really wonder how many people who've been writing reviews about The Janson Directive have read any other Ludlum books. This is not vintage Ludlum. It was certainly not written by him. First, the dialogue is too fresh, and that points to a younger writer. Secondly, after around page 200 or so, after the plane blows up, the story goes downhill. Up to 200, it may have been Ludlum. But after that it just goes down. The suspense of the book died then, replaced by action, too much detail on the technology of the guns or cars being driven, and the angles each shot came from. After the plane exploded, there was only one twist, at the end, that just about anyone could have seen coming. From any other author, this would be a four or a five, but if you put the name Robert Ludlum on a book, I'm expecting something better."
positive,Fantastic Sony Walkman,"I received my Sony Walkman today that is capable of fitting in Wristband case for easy use and convenience. For its small size, it has great sound & construction quality; range & channel pick up; digital tuning; built in clock; & 5 preset radio stations at a fantastic price."
negative,Lasted 6 months - Horrible Customer Service,"Great camera, took great pics, everyone loved it. Then one day I went to turn it on and half the screen was black and distorted. The unit was kept in a case and experienced no abuse. I called Casio who said to send it in to an authorized dealer for repair. Six calls and a month later, no repair and a bill for $200 to repair a camera that cost $300 only 6 months from purchase. Neither Casio or the authorized dealer are any help. The LCD display (one of the main reasons for buying) is not covered. As much as I love this camera, I would never buy a Casio again. Terrible customer service and a practically non-existent warranty."
negative,Not widescreen format even though cover says so!,The movie was not in widescreen format even though the cover says so! Why do these mistakes keep happening by these dvd companies?
positive,"Good, but....",Just saying. There should be Japanese actors portraying Japanese people. Other than that. It's good.
positive,great camera!!!,this camera is great for the money!! no need to go for much more expensive ones like creative and logitech...do not hesistate and buy this one...
negative,POP NOT COUNTRY,"The Dixie Chicks were driven out of country music where they never belonged IMHO. If you like your bluegrass pop I guess maybe you might like this, but listen to the real thing (Bill Monroe, Rhonda Vincent) and you'll be able to tell the difference.This is Yankee Bluegrass, Not to be Confused with the REAL THING!!Besides all this these people do not deserve our support!"
positive,Wonderful starter train for your toddler!,"My son received this train when he was 16 months old, he is now 23 months old. I cannot believe how much he STILL adores this simple, yet adorable train set. Almost every other day he reaches into the closet to grab the box out so he can play with it. He loves to set it up & take it apart as well. This would make a great gift to any child who is old enough for their 1st train set. I've since purchased additional ""add ons"" from the Brio line. My son loves the steam locomotive with lights & sounds. He also loves the tunnel the train goes through. We definitely prefer this BRIO battery operated 1st train set over the plain one. Beautifully made & will last forever, my 2nd son who is only 6 months old will surely enjoy this as well someday. A great purchase that continues to keep my son entertained!"
positive,Well Worth The Price,Totally happy with my clothes bar. It fit well in my vehicle and held more then enough clothes to make my trip.
positive,hair dryer,"This is a great dryer for curlie hair. Don't forget to clean the filter. I did and the dryer stopped working. so now, I purchased need a new one."
negative,zack and miri make a not so good movie,"So, i was hoping for the better with this movie as i have been very disappointed with kevin smith movies since he ended the trilogy, but the better did not happen. It had ok moments, but that was about it. It seemed as though he was trying to be a bit like the apatow brand movies, but couldn't pull it off as well. i like the concept of the movie and the cast, but it just didn't seem like he thought it through well enough."
negative,"The not so good story of a girl, her mother and grandmother",~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I thought that Toning the Sweep was a good quick read if you are able to deal with boring chapters where nothing really ground breaking or important happens. If I had had a choice I would not have read this book at all. I think if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 I would give it a 2 since it wasn't that that good of a book in my opinion. I kept waiting for the book to get good but it never did =(!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
positive,Whimsical and frequently hilarious,"This is the book on my bedside table that I reach for when I need a tender laugh, a bittersweet glimpse into a real woman's life. Jackie Jernigan's wit is unique, and her imagination transforms ordinary occasions into adventures. Highly recommended!"
positive,So far so good,"I had no complains so far about this Wireless adapter, it has a good range and it's easy to install. I will review this comment in a few months but so far so good..."
negative,A Major disappointment,"First of all, the title...Banned and Censored...by whom? The Pvt. Snafus were made for the military (certainly THEY didn't ban them) and Easy Does It is a 20 min. commercial for a canned vegitable company (who the audience for that was and where it was presented eludes me..) The rest were released for general consumption, but again, banned by whom? The studio? Hayes code?Distributors? TV?Secondly, the reasons for their being banned are often quetionable at best, ludicrous at worst. Alleged homosexuality from clothed bathing? PLEASE!Thirdly, with the exception of the delightful Betty Boop/Koko films and the Snafu shorts, the remaining 'toons don't even cut it as entertaining (IMO). THat's my two cents...YMMV"
positive,Fine Power Pop Album,"One of the world's truly great singers delivers a bold, energetic and unashamedly pop album. The renewed interest in 80s music should bring new attention to this fine effort, being on the cusp of the 90s. I played this album to death on its release and was quite disappointed with the mellow Adult Oriented Rock turn in subsequent releases. Sure, the power ballad allows Arena to showcase her voice (and what a voice it is!), but the songs lack the fire and energy of this first CD.It is a matter of musical taste of course, and it's unlikely this album will appeal to the grandparents toward whom the later albums were aimed. But if you prefer explosive rock to the slow sizzle of a torch song, this is an album you can never play loud enough! Her subsequent albums are fine, but not as much to my taste as Strong As Steel. I wish she's made a few more like this one."
negative,"Sorry, but this CD was not good",This CD was very disappointing she only had a couple of good songs on here...this cd has been collecting dust the day after I bought it. I hope the next album will be a whole lot better than this one.

positive,"Finally! The remake of his original ""Viva Terlingua"" Album","Jerry Jeff had some real problems with his previous record label. After years of being held hostage, he's finally re-recorded all of my favorites from the Viva Terlingua Album. I wore out that tape and am thrilled to have it on CD. Thanks Jerry Jeff! I'm glad to have your classic voice back in my collection."
positive,Precious,"I have used this delightful video in my music classes for more than 20 years. I was afraid it would break, so I ordered one for me and one for a friend. We are both very happy with the purchase."
negative,Terrible-DO NOT BUY,"I bought this product thinking I had found a steal at 20-odd dollars. I NEVER RECIEVED THE PRODUCT BECAUSE MY ADDRESS FROM YEARS AGO WAS ATTACHED TO THE SHIPPING RECORDS. AFTER CONTACTING THE SELLER AND AMAZON I WAS TOLD I WAS SOL ($H!T OUTTA LUCK). SO LESSON TO THE WISE, READ THE FINER PRINT, ITS A SHELL OF THE CPU(CASE) NOT THE SYSTEM!!!AMAZON WILL NOT GET ANYMORE OF MY BUSINESS BC IT WAS NOT THE FIRST ITEM I HAD NOT RECIEVED..."
negative,Ummmm....,"After reading all the great reviews I was so excited to get the cream! Well, it did not live up to expectations..AT ALL!!! If you have sensitive skin, dont even try it! Within a week my face was so read and started breaking out! It is also not good to wear under makeup b/c it doesnt absorb well. I am now trying Murad and I hope it works!"
positive,As requested,"I have not field tested these binoculars yet, but have viewed the neighborhood and they appear adequate. I will certainly use them on my travels in Israel this Spring."
positive,"Good Multiplayer, Single player is not worth it","The single player is horrible; I did not even want to play past the second level.The multiplayer online was decent, however, it comes nowhere close to the standard in online shooters, Socom 2. I don't understand why other game companies can't take some good ideas from Socom and use it in their games. This game would be really good if it had online clans and a good friends list, but for some reason the developers didn't think of having that. IMO if they had those features, the game would be right up there with Socom.The maps on the multiplayer are very big and are really interesting. You can get into almost every building on every map. There are many maps to choose from, I think 23. There are four different roles that the players can choose to be.Rent this game...don't buy it."
positive,Reflections on Memoirs,"Memiors of a Geisha is a great read. It is the type of book you read and love, but also the type of book you give as a gift. I found Memoirs astonishing in its credibility. After the first few chapters, I completely forgot that it was a work of fiction. It was only when I finished the novel and was confronted with the picture of Arthur S. Golden on the back flap that I realize that I had not just finished an autobiography. Anyway, just wanted to add my two cents to the million other review of this book. =)"
negative,A software dud,"Britannica is the best encyclopedia in print. Why, oh why, can't they get the software right? Examples: The video clips are stock footage of no instructional purpose, some are simply of animals grazing (dumb!), the audio clips are few and far between, as are the video clips. This is multimedia circa 1985! Not 2002! The clipboard function explanation was confusing. The navigator was slow and only touched upon articles directly related to the topic. What happened to a macropedia?I was disappointed by this. Maybe they will get it right in a few years. As it is, it is a very unimpressive cd-rom and will put you to sleep."
negative,"Don't buy it, it's out of stock with no backorder date",I placed the order on the Dec 14th. Now it's the 28th. The order goes to some Automotive supply store called Midway. The web site still shows there are 5 in stock. But the item was back ordered. I called Midway today and they can't tell me when the order will be filled.
negative,Laughing all the way to the bank.,"I don't have this CD, nor will I buy anything by Britney. I have unfortunately seen her lip sync during music shows and have heard quite a few of her new songs.Britney is a marketing strategy. Her mother and management team have used Britney to make millions. I guess it worked. Well, at least Madonna can sing live. Britney sounds like Minnie Mouse with a cold.Somebody give her a box of Kleenex."
negative,Too much reliance on FBI files.,"This book was thoroughly researched, evidently in an attempt to confirm the FBI version of the hunt for Charles Arthur Floyd. While the author uses multiple sources, including many from Oklahoma lawmen, when the story reaches the critical time of the Kansas City massacre and afterward, he relies almost solely on information provided by the FBI, which is completely unreliable. Most eyewitnesses did not place Floyd or Richetti at Union Station at the time of the killings. The federal prosecutor refused to try Richetti in Federal Court because of lack of evidence. He was then tried in state court, found guilty, and executed. Pretty Boy Floyd died from two .45 caliber gunshot wounds to the chest. How does an individual fleeing law enforcement officers get shot in the chest? The more one thinks about this incident, the more questions arise. It is a shame that the truth will never really be known about what happened at Union Station or about how Charley Floyd actually died."
negative,WTH???,"A car seat is for protecting your child who is NOT BIG ENOUGH to sit in a regular seat (57"" tall and 80 lbs.). This seat does not provide ANY protection at all for a child in a car! If your child was in this ""SEAT"" and you were in an automobile accident they would NOT BE PROTECTED from INJURY OR DEATH! I guess if you are willing to risk your child's life for a little 'convenience' this would be a good purchase. i hope people will think twice before purchasing this."
negative,Good when it works,"I bought this nailer back in October of 2004 and since the the first day of use there has been nothing but trouble. It jammed on me many times before I realized it needed to be lubricated several times throughout the days time. It is now January and I went to use it on another job and it just didn't work at all, it is now in for service and I hope the warranty will cover the problems."
negative,Do not buy!,Poorly designed. Blade falls out when open and being used. I spend as much time picking up my blade as I do cutting anything. I work in a lumber yard and use knives for everything from opening boxes and packing slips to cutting plastic bands on bunks of lumber. This knife has a faulty blade lock. And I don't think the thing is even made by Gerber like advertised. Nowhere on the knife or the packaging does it reference Gerber. Go figure.Laters
negative,Not a tight fit,I purchased this product at Walmart to use with our portable dvd players. The plug does not fit snuggly and falls out easily. The part that fits into the cigarette lighter is a great fit. It's the end that attaches to the dvd player that is the problem. I'll be exchaning it for another brand.
positive,Romantic fun,Isabella Rossellini is so feminine that the other women in the movie seem ordinary. The story is different. It is a light movie to watch when you have a little time to yourself and just want to enjoy it.
negative,for show only,"Serves the purpose of a TSA lock, but not much more. Can be easy open by any determined would be thief"
positive,Enjoyable Fun Little Movie,"New interpretations of some classic Our Gang bits, a few cameos and decent production value. Its a fun little movie and the kids are fun to watch. They're poor actors, just like the originals, although the Spanky and Alfalfa that people remember from the late 30s were probably more polished than any of these kids.My only complaint is the DVD edition seems to be the same edited version as the old VHS. There are a few gags that are either incomplete, or missing altogether, but you can kind of tell where they belong (like the gentlemen walking into the bank). There is also a funny extended trial scene that is much abbreviated in this version. I remember seeing the missing scenes on TV oddly enough. If they ever re-release this movie I hope it will be a more complete edit."
negative,Hard on the eyes !,The fact that it is a typo reproduction of the original needs to be highlighted.The type is miniscule - hardly usable.
negative,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is the worst CD I have bought in YEARS! Morsheeba seems to have all of the right elements. The music is good, the singing is good, but it does not fit. I think the writing and lyrics are a bit off and may the reason that it does not come together. I am a very open minded person and I look for the good in everything, but just could not find it here."
positive,French Press is the best,"Great redo of the classic.Makes great coffee. Need to have a good grinder and top coffee to really get the best out of it. Always use softened filtered water. I originally bought the version that came with the nifty 4 minute timer. This one didn't and though it was cheaper, I think it is a better value to buy the one that comes with the timer if you need that."
negative,"Fairly well written, but rather dull","It starts off with a bang, a great scene at an archaoelogical site, but peters out soon thereafter. Too many characters, two storylines, neither of which is very interesting. We see tihngs fromt the point of view of a possessed spider! C'mon, that's just plain silly. Too bad, because the author has good skills and command of the language. It's the story he tells that falls flat."
negative,its not worth it,"I thought this would be nice, but I think its was money wasted.Its to hard to push in the ground,if it was sand it might would be easy ,but in dirt it to much work. I would rather plant my hand."
negative,not as great as previous reviews,"I was very excited to get this game as I have 2 kids who love to play games on our new Wii. The reviews made it too hard to pass up for the price, but I have been very dissappointed. First, its extremely hard to find any games unless you have the booklet on hand to find out which heading each game is found under. The games are not listed anywhere on the game that I can find, so you have to refer back to the booklet each time you want to change games. The directions for each game are a joke. We spent most of the first hour figuring out where to locate each game and how to play the game, then once we figured it out, the games werent really fun, even for my 6 yr old.We opened this up, popped it in, messed around for about an hour or so and put it away unhappy and have not played with it anymore.Others seem to have liked this game according to the reviews, but my family has not gotten any enjoyment out of it at all."
negative,What the...?,"This book does not make any sense nor does it serve any purpose. It's not not even remotely entertaining! I recommend ""The Meaning of Life"" by Bradley Trevor Greive instead. It's inspirational, funny, and so very clever (unlike this book)."
negative,I hit my b-70,For three months I loved this machine now I beat it with my can opener. It won't brew when it says it ready. Now I am searching for a better model or brand. Any ideas?
positive,I love It!,This is actually a really simple product to use and it works just as great or better than alot of the more expensive ones. It is easy for anyone of any age to use. I would definitely recommend this.
positive,cupholder solution,"I bought this booster in February and love it. I thought I would share a solution I found for the cupholder that has worked for us from day one. I bought a cheap white plastic cup at Party City for approximately .69 cents with the Disney Princesses on it. They make all characters. The base of the cup snugly fits in the Britax cup holder and the princess cup is large enough that we use it as our modified cupholder. All of my daughter's bottled waters, sippy cups, even fast food cups fit inside. I never remove it except for cleaning and it works great! It did crack a little at the base from the pressure and indentions of the Britax cupholder, so you must remember not to pour liquid directly into it or you will have a leak. I have been using the same cup for five months now with success. Good luck!"
negative,Arrived damaged - returned,"I bought this roaster because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen, but it arrived damaged with two gouges in the exterior. I was in a pinch for a holiday dinner and was going to use it anyway, but within hours after washing it started to rust. It feels lightweight as well and didn't fit my roasting rack."
negative,A disappointment,"I was very troubled reading this book. The women are very weak characters. Their husband cheats on them and verbally abuses one of the wives. The women are submissive and pathetic. I was so angry, that I couldn't even finish this book. As for the historical fiction aspect of the book, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. If you are looking for a bible story where women are treated like animals, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a historical perspective on the time period, this is not the right book."
positive,Definitely Some Good Dayz!,"Joe does an excellent job on Better Days with his soulful voice and smooth ballads. Hands down, Joe is an exceptional talent that should be recognized. He's by far one of the best male singers out there right next to Luther Vandross. Joe's intoxicating love ballads leave you feeling loved, respected, and most all cherished as a woman. As a man his songs shows you how to love, respect, and appreciate your woman. This is truly a man who indeed knows how to appreciate a woman.Joe demonstrates his tenderness on such songs as ""What If A Woman"" ""Ghetto Child"" ""She Used 2 Luv Me"" and the most beautiful song ever ""Lover's Prayer"". If you're looking for Better Days ahead, buy this album. I promise, you won't regret it."
negative,i have not yet received an issue.,I have not yet receives an issue to rate this magazine.. I will be to rate it when I do.
negative,ring,"It is a cute ring, but s small, not much about it - not crazy about it - never wore it. Gave it to my niece. You get what you paid for on this one. Sorry."
negative,Reception stinks --very disappointed,"Don't let the looks fool you. Yes, it's a little cutie, but it's all on the surface. My 5 year old 900mhz phone has better clarity and reception.I exchanged it because the reception was so bad. Snap-Crackle-Pop!Also had an echo problem along with the snapping, crackling, and popping. I would not recommend this phone."
positive,Another Home Run!,"If you love a fast paced read, then you have to get to know Jack Reacher. Love the whole series."
negative,Different Product -- NO Airplane Adapter,"The delivered product was different from the product listed on this page: The delivered product had NO airplane adapter, despite the product description and the linked manual stating otherwise. Since I bought it specifically for use on an upcoming plane trip, this product is completely useless to me. Instead, the product contains an extra cable to connect it directly to a car battery; it also includes a connector for the standard cigarette lighter.If you are only planning to use this product in a car or from a car battery, it may work fine. However, if you are planning to use it on an airplane, you are out of luck."
negative,Crossing to Safety,"I have talked to others and all either loved the book or could not even finish it. I could hardly finish it. The problem is nothing happens which makes the book too drawn out. I found the first 1/3 of the book was enjoyable enough, but after that I felt nothing was going to happen, and realizing this, I did not want to continue reading to discover I was correct. All the while, Stegner congratulates himself that a book can be written about nothing and people will enjoy it (one main character is also an author, maybe even Stegner). If you want to read about two couples, one with a very controlling wife, and their not too exciting lives then this book is for you. But do not read it for other reasons because the writing, the character development, even the description of the couples' relationship is average at best."
negative,"""Walnut"" finish is actually ""Cherry""","This is the first time I have written a review for an Amazon purchase. I decided to write one this time because I don't want others to fall into the same trap. The ""walnut"" finish table is NOT walnut --> it's CHERRY. Also, the top of the table was a lighter shade than the rest of the pieces. I am returning this product for a refund."
negative,WHAT?,"The songs in the movie is super great, but the soundtrack.. what happened?? Where are the songs sung by Kelly Preston? The producers made a mistake when leaving those out."
negative,Horrible,another corny lead single&More dissing which is played out. the Production is the same as His Previous lead in singles for Projects. nothing ever changes with this Cat.Boring&Vastly Overrated.
negative,Know the hidden requirements before you buy!,"I recommend you call Netgear and ask them if you system is compatible with this adapter before you buy. I doesn't work with certain certain chipsets (I think the VIA chipsets -- which are pretty common).My frustration was that I found this information out only after I'd bought the thing.If you're looking for an ethernet adapter for a laptop, I recommend a PCMCIA card; that was my eventual solution. They are more reliable (and faster)."
positive,LOVE this series!,I absolutely adore this series. This season was a good continuation of the last one and i'm glad this is the one that's true to the manga. Absolutely great show!
positive,Dvorak String Quartets (complete)/DG/Prager,"Recording includes Dvorak's complete string quartets on 9 CDs by the Prager String Quartet. The performances are excellent. The recordings are very good (SPARS code: ADD). The recording dates are 1973-1977. Good notes. Very compact packaging (stiff paper envelopes for each CD, in cardboard box -- no jewel boxes). Recommended. Amazon had the best price of the sources that I checked."
positive,...a very useful camera!,"I bought two Fuji FinePix A101 a few days ago, and I have to say it is a good camera. It is accessible (cheap) and easy to use, one big advantage is that downloads pictures really fast.Maybe is not an impressive camera, but it is very useful."
negative,bad deal - only 5 episodes,"This is a bad deal--there are only 5 episodes. The better deal is to purchase the season 1 & 2 combo pack, since there are 5 and 13 episodes, respectively. Monetarily, it is better to purchase the combo pack."
negative,DEFECTIVE BY DESIGN!,"The kindle is the next greatest thing since the Sony root kit.You dont really own your books. Amazon can delete them from the hardware you purchased with software they installed on it with out your permission. The least they could do is let you know that it is on the Kindle and what it is capable of.How would you feel if you woke up one morning and all of your favorite books had dissappeared off the shelves in your house. The DRM in the Kindle can do just that. They proved it with the great Kindle Swindle by deleting books that people had paid for. What is amazon's policy for refunding the money your customers had stolen from them when you deleted their books?defectivebydesign, kindle swindle, and 1984."
negative,Very misleading title,"If you step into the Java universe bubble, then ""Java Collections"" means the standard core API with the same name. This book does not cover the standard classes and interfaces that form the Java Collections API, and this is a real shame. I don't like books that feature highly misleading titles, because it hints at a lack of accuracy of the book's content."
negative,chicken,The product was a pinkish color. It did not match what I saw online. When I got the order it was crushed inside of the package and therefore ruin the shape.
negative,Not rrigourus enough,"Honestly, I was dissappointed in this book. It was too basic and didnt really explain anything in a great amount of detail. The exersizes were way too easy. I am an undergraduate physics major, there is no reason I should be able to do every problem in a chapter in 2 or 3 hours. That is unheard of. I really did not learn any thing from this book. Maybe it is good for a review, but it really is not good for learning the topic for the first time. Find something more detailed and rigorous."
negative,No Need For This,"There is no need to purchase this software it does not help you with payroll, the best thing is to use online payroll services such as intuit. This software was a complete waste of time and money I ended up having to use intuit anyways to do my payroll."
positive,AN EXECELLENT BOOK THAT KEEPS YOU UPDATED ON GUNS & AMMO,"GUN DIGEST IS AN EXCELLENT PUBLICATION ABOUT GUN & AMMO THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET TODAY. I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS BOOK EVERY YEAR SINCE 1980. DUE TO MY PREOCCUPATION I MISSED 1988, 1999 & 2000 EDITIONS WHICH I SHALL ORDER VIA THE INTERNET THROUGH AMAZON.COM. THIS BOOK WAS HELPFUL IN MY CAREER AS IT EXPANDED YOUR KNOWLEDGE MORESO WHEN I AM SO FOND OF HUNTING & SHOOTING."
positive,Simple words/great story,"I teach first grade and was looking for material for my small reading groups. This will be perfect. The author tells a cute story that I know my students will enjoy, using simple words, most of which they've learned by this point in the year (second quarter). Excellent illustrations are used to support the limited text. I just ordered 5 more copies. :)Sample pages:p.1 Jack and Jill and Big Dog Bill go up, up, up the hill.p. 7 At the top, they stop.p. 21 ""Oh, no,"" say Jack and Jill. ""Bill will not go!"""
negative,BOYCOTT THIS DVD,Before you can watch this DVD you must sit through 10 minutes of Universal Studios commercials. There is no way to bypass the commercials. Please help support the boycott of this highly unethical practice of forcing customers to watch commercials. You wouldn't stand for listening to commerical on a music CD would you? Why stand for it on DVDs.
negative,Anybody????,"I may be interested in buying this cd. Has anyone purchased it? What is the sound quality like? Are these original recordings? I notice several reviewers saying there were no song titles listed. Now that the titles have apparently been listed, has anyone got a copy of this particular disc? I'd like to know what you think!How was the product delivered? Did you receive it quickly?Anybody???????"
positive,Great Resource for traveling,The book was well written and organized. It was easy to look up information about all different types of subjects. We used this book on our trip to Cancun and we maximized our adventures during our stay.Jim Kerr
negative,5 star book by a fine scholar,"This is an excellent book that has the courage to tell the truth about the creation of Israel. And what infuriates the Zionists the most is that it is by a Jewish scholar whose family suffered during the Holocaust. Not some ""anti-Semite"" who could be smeared and dismissed. I give the book five stars but for some reason Amazon's website will onlly register two. It's a five star book."
negative,Oh Please!,"This is in reference to all those people who said that Toby Lightman's version of ""Real Love"" was better than Mary J. Blige's. Apparently, Mary is still making albums, putting out hit music, AND getting radio airplay. And where is Toby Lightman? I REST MY CASE!"
positive,Paul Carrack CD,Love this CD. A friend shared a Paul Carrack song on FB. I had never heard of him. I went to iTunes and downloaded a few songs. They had a limited selection of his music. So glad I ordered this CD.
positive,A personal style bible!,"This fashionable duo made a splash in the UK with their popular BBC TV show: ""What Not To Wear"" that was copied in the US. This book is an absolute must for anyone looking to build a stylish, personalized wardrobe that will last a lifetime. They really focus on what fits and flatters your body type, coloring and lifestyle. They are no-nonsense truth-tellers and funny to boot! Every one of their books is an eye-opener and I can attest that deciding to get serious about my wardrobe and dress in only the clothes that are most flattering for me has indeed changed my life. Most importantly I have stopped making costly foolish mistakes when I go shopping. Following the recommendations in the book I can honestly say that I now wear everything in my closet, feel like most days I look pretty good and buy a lot less. I noticed the book in a couple of boutiques that use it as a style guide as well."
negative,Mehldau's Worst,"I'm a fan of Brad Mehldau; he's an inventive pianist with good chops. Nonetheless Largo stinks for the following reasons: 1. The horn arrangements were musically unexpressive. They evoked neither emotion or interest and distracted me from the piano playing. Superfluous, cheezy, and annoying. 2. Mehldau's improvisations were inhibited. His playing was not as interesting or moving as on trio albums. 3. While I sometimes enjoy ""jam band"" and fusion albums, Mehldau doesn't sound good in that type of setting, at least on this album. Again, his playing is unexpressive.Largo isn't all bad. My favorite track was Dear Prudence; the tune sounded pretty in a jazz setting, and Mehldau played simple eloquent lines. But my overall opinion is that Largo is an overproduced cheap shot for a few extra bucks. Instead, I suggest ""Introducing Brad Mehldau"" or ""Art of the Trio: Vol 1."""
positive,Don't let it scare you off,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was the weirdest and oddest thing I had ever seen. I only rented it because I love Anthony Perkins. Well, I ended up reading the novel. I recommend doing this first. It makes this movie much clearer. Now I must say that I love this movie. It is gripping, intriguing and even funny at times. I hope you love Joseph K. and Leni as much as I do!"
positive,i love this album,"i love this album. it has some very good songs on it. i like the songs anything is possible, one hand one heart,one step ahead,and another brick falls. i think you will enjoy this if you pick it up."
positive,This book should be a MUST READ,"There are many imitations to the subject, but there's no replacing the classics. Even though the slang is straight from the 70's, Chaney Allen is one of the most honest and straightforward authors I've ever read. Her wisdom, courage and spirit was felt by this reader. Not only does she give wonderful advice on recovery, but is good for life, period. IMHO, college students should read this book, especially freshmen leaving home for the 1st time."
negative,Not really that great,"Pros: Cute, lightweightCons: Cheaply madeThe elastic and velcro straps that attach the wings to your child are small and caused the jetpack to be very tight to my 3 yr olds body. Because the jetpack is inflatable, it you blow it up all the way, the center between the wings gets very rounded and made the jetpack keep slipping up my sons body and hitting him in the head. He didn't enjoy wearing it very long to say the least."
negative,THIS BOOK IS GREATLY OVER-RATED,"The book starts out good in the first half but then gets worse and worse. There is too much of constant techno-babble and dogfights that really become boring and irritating. Many things in the plot have nothing to do with the game and are there just to lenghten the story (ex: St. Johns's wife hostage situation etc). Although there is a lot of humor in the book that made me crack up, the rest made me grit my teeth as I struggled to read on. I have come to know every Descent game very well and was greatly disappointed by this book. It could have been a lot better."
positive,Useful and concrete advice,"This book explains that people who are targets of verbal abuse aren't helpless, and provides them with strategies for verbal self-defense. The approach is not ""blaming"" the targeted individuals -- it's empowering them. Elgin has never suggested, either in print or aloud, that verbal abuse victims are responsible for the hostile language environments that make their lives miserable, but she has told them how to take control and cure their environments. This book teaches that at a level written to those who need it most."
negative,I give this purchase a 1 out of 10,"I am very unhappy with my purchase. I bought Deadly Matrimony and was so excited to get it, once i popped it into the VCR it was jumping, the sound was up and down and half the time you coulnt even see the picture because of all of the lines going through the screen. We tried to track it with absolutely no luck. I fast forwarded and then rewound thinking that the tape might just be loose and we didnt have any luck. It is pointless to even try to watch the movie because it is such a disapointment."
positive,awsome,"great movie, I love john wayne's movies he is and was a great actor, would definately recomend this movie to friends and family"
positive,Great Stress Reliever,"I used to get really sore muscles and even migraines from stress. This pilates video has significantly helped me reduce my stress level, and I no longer have muscle aches caused by stress. Not only that, I've noticed my abdominal muscles are stonger. I strongly recommend this video to anyone looking to reduce stress and get a good strength training workout at the same time."
positive,Closer to perfection,"This series seems to get better and better..It has the right amount of pathos thrown in with the blackest of comedies.Brenda and her team face a tough season, as they are asked to allow a reporter to tag along, who along the way manages to throw a spanner in the works of the Proirity Homicide unit. Not only this, but a memeber of the team also has to deal with a personal loss, and with all that going on Brenda and Fitz are about to tie the knot.The dvd extra's are a bit dissapointing, as there aren't any interviews with the cast and only a few behind the scenes and a funny gag reel..but having said this it's worth buying..trust me you won't be dissapointed.. and in the word of Brenda Lee Johnson 'thank you..thank you very much'!"
negative,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 MONTHS!,"I really liked it until it went totally dead. I left it plugged into my pc overnight & next morning it was totally dead. Can't get it to respond on any pc. I tried 3 of them. It is totally dead... Luckily, I had it backed up.I'll keep you posted on what Sandisk does about it.It has now been 1 month since I complained to Sandisk.It took them about 2 weeks to send me an RMA & that only came after I called on the phone. I got no response from my online complaint. I sent it back within a day. And now it's been a month since I originally complained & still no replacement... Although my account says closed because it was an even exchange. When I can expect this exchange I do not know..."
positive,A helpful reference,"Most breastfeeding moms would benefit from this book, and as someone with a strong instinct to breastfeed, but supply issues, I found it helpful for the most part. As a quick reference it was pretty good - most of the FAQ'were answered. I'm glad to have it."
positive,EXCELLENT!!!!,"i'm only 14 yrs. old and White Christmas is one of my favorite Christmas movies! you wouldn't think a kid would like ""oldies"" but i do! this one is the PERFECT Christmas film with a grand ended of . . .well if you haven't seen it I won't tell you.It is a fantanstic movie!!!!"
negative,not a fan,"We just needed a temporary coat rack while we lived with my in-laws. While it never did tip over, there were a few close calls after we piled all our coats on them (only about 6 coats). I didn't like my son playing around it as I thought it was going to come crashing down on him. It now resides in a room awaiting disposal as we don't know what else to do with it."
negative,Blessing or Curse?,"In theory, this product seems like a great idea, however, the SLIGHTEST breeze sends the Rayshade everywhere but where you want it to be. I don't exactly find it enjoyable to have to adjust this product every block or so during my walks and jogs."
positive,nice and simple,"nice and simple. I got my product in a timely manner at a good price. I will say the wrist part is small and the wrist cover comes off frequently, would be nice if it would stay on. But its not really a big deal."
positive,Nice option for feeding cats,"Nice, simple feeding toy for cats. Easy to use and clean, easy to adjust the difficulty. My cats don't love it - but I just introduced it at the ages of 9 & 7 and I think they just prefer the easy way to eat. It is good activity for them and they can use it without difficulty."
positive,Conscious Capitalism is a must for the new century.,"In 'Conscious Capitalism' David Schwerin goes beyond what we normally consider business ethics. He gives his readers a deep spiritual foundation for values in business, something that we've rarely seen in the twentieth century but that will surely be crucial for the twenty-first century.Author David Schwerin is that rare combination of successful businessman and esoteric scholar. And this combination makes for a fascinating book, both instructive and insightful, and with compelling examples and stories.If any reader wants to know what spiritual and ethical business will look like in the future, this is the book to read. We can't recommend it highly enough!"
negative,Configuration is big task,"I bought the product 2 weeks before and I have a thought this will work with all printers but not. D Link technical support is very bad I called at least 10 times to find my printer is compatible or not.User manual is not complete so configuration is very difficult. Changing the IP Address manually and re assigning the new IP Address is very difficult. And it cause problem for other wireless divices (Mouse,Keyboard,Wireless web camera and External wireless hard disk). Because of this product I spend almost 8 hrs to solve other wireless network issues.If you have enough time then it will entertain you."
negative,Don't buy this cover unless you want water puddles inside the grill,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on Amazon before buying. I just ""assumed"" that the Weber grill cover was the one to use with my new grill. We had rain the same day I put on the cover...puddles of rain on the side burner sections; moisture on top of the grill. Who needs it. I did what others suggested here and elsewhere...I went to Home Depot and got the corresponding Charmglow cover for less $$ and no vents!"
negative,Functional but Tedius,"- Hard to clean. Lots of unscrewing and dismantlement just to clean some areas.- Dirty water shoots out of the front if its just a ""little"" too full.+ Its cheap"
positive,Great headphones for the price.,"These replaced an older set of Sony headphones. Overall a nice set for the money.Pro: Very comfortable. Sound quality is good for the price.Con: Cable is very long. Much longer than any headphone setI have ever had. Use mostly with PC, so don't really need thatmuch and tends to get in the way. Cable is also much thinnerthan previous sets that I have owned."
positive,Great Vacuum,"I have been using an upright for quite a few years and hated it. We heat with wood stoves so I get a lot of wood chips on the floors as well as a lot of dust. Since I have arthritic knees and had trouble pushing the upright I decided it was time to go with a cannister vacuum. After doing some research on this one, I ordered it and vacuum at least 3x a week now. I can't believe how much it picks up every time I vacuum. I am now buying a second one for my daughter for Christmas."
positive,Black Eyed Peas Bring The Funk!,"This is the best album I have heard this year. I have looked over other reviews, and I don't think that these people giving the album 1 star know what they are talking about. ""Where Is The Love"" is an amazing track, however is not the only bright spot on the album. Elephunk has many songs that could be hits, such as ""Hands Up"", ""Shut Up"", ""Labor Day(It's A Holiday)"", ""Latin Girls"", ""Fly Away"", and ""Anxiety"". They explore so many kinds of music on this album. That's what makes Elephunk such a great CD. The addition of Fergie adds a whole new part to their music that we haven't heard before. If it is true that this is going to be their last album, I think they should definitely rethink that. I think Black Eyed Peas could have a whole lot of good music to come."
positive,Good movie!,"Here's another well-done movie from Hilary Duff. Sad, yes, but it's realistic and death does happen in real life. However, it's very inspiring when you see how Terri Fletcher doesn't give up music and goes to the music school. It's funny in places, too. Yes, this is a film that's family friendly, which is quite usual for Hilary Duff. However, her latest movie, The Perfect Man, sounds bland, boring and compromised.All in all, a film worth seeing, maybe even buying."
positive,VERY comprehensive with a great John Inman section...,"Great book for fans of ""Are You Being Served?"" and it's spin-offs!! Detailed synopsis' of each episode including the Australian and doomed American versions! END"
negative,This toy is worthless,You can pump this worthless toy all day and it has maybe a 15 ft range for at least a few seconds. This does not do anything it's advertised to do. And the 30' range is total fantasy. I wasted $19 and it's now in the trash where it belongs.
positive,Stove covers,I think the covers are perfect They make my stove look great I love them They complete my stove & protects the top of my stove.
positive,"Colorful, fun and versatile mobile","This is my go-to gift for friends who have new babies. We received this mobile, and hung it over our kitchen table when my son was younger. The birds have magnets in them, and when you swing them around, they bounce. It provided a lot of entertainment for little eyes. The birds can be easily removed from the mobile (by magnet, again) and some squeak. Once my son was past the mobile stage, we moved the birds to the fridge, where at 2 1/2 he still plays with them."
negative,Ya get what ya pay for,"Cheap clock, didn't expect top notch for the price, but...The second hand was loose in the case, we disassembled the case and fixed it on the second try. The hang hole on the back couldn't handle a standard sheet rock screw which should be the typical expectation unless they provide something else, which they did not."
negative,Waste of money,"I have long thick curly hair. This towel does not make my hair dry faster. I need two of these towels, because they are very thin, and the first towel becomes saturated after a few minutes, so I have to use a second towel. One normal thicker cotton towel does the job. This towel is also not quite large enough to make a good turban. It creates a ton of static in the dryer with my cotton towels. My hair is not any less frizzy. I tried the ""plunking"" method and that did not improve my curls and made my bangs go wierd. So save your money. This is an overpriced synthetic towel. Maybe good for your gym bag if you have short or thin hair."
positive,Works but I wonder if It really fits,The wires work but you have to push really hard for the caps to fit on the engine. I don't know if this is a product defect but it's been a little over 6months and it's still working fine.
negative,THIS PRODUCT BY SONY IS JUNK,"I WILL NEVER BUY ANY OTHER MEMORY FROM SONY EVER AGAIN I DO NOT CARE HOW CHEAP IS ITIS A PIECE OF JUNK I USED FOR A FAMILY PICTURES AND 2 MONTHS LATER THIS JUNK SAID CAN""T READ IT AND NOW ALL MY FAMILY PICTURESARE LOSS SINCE CAN""T TRANSFER TO A BETTER MEMORY CARD"
negative,Ideas expressed here are simple and common,"I purchased this publication anticipating some analytical explanation as to, ""Why he was not a Christian"" unfortunately this entire book stated only elementary ideas and, quite honestly I was to the point that I wanted the book to end. The entire appendix, (1/4 of the book) consists of the court battle Russell had with the state of NY. Evidently Russell has simply congregated a assortment of his most rudimentary essays and attempted to structure a coherent, logical book. He has failed miserably...."
negative,dont read this book,I thought the book was not all that great. It was kind of boring. I fell asleep a couple of times. If you want a good action book dont read this book. I'm not trying to put anyone down. I am just trying to save you time...
negative,Divorce is ugly,"This is an old DVD released in 2001 with absolutely no specials, commentary, or even subtitles. The picture quality is fine for an old movie(from 1973). The DVD contains two parts(His/Her).The Divorce His part contains numerous flashback scenes from the husband's viewpoint. Before a flashback, Burton's character goes into a zone, then the flashback begins. I found the flashbacks to be disruptive, like someone cutting into a conversation.Divorce Hers(just like His) contains plenty of long, drawn-out(and overly dramatic) conversations. Liz Taylor's character spends plenty of time 'yelping' about her troubles.I came in with an open-mind and tried to enjoy this movie, but I got bored pretty quick. Everyone has their own opinion; I still think Liz Taylor looks beautiful in this movie(in an older sort of way). That was the only somewhat enjoyable part of this movie."
positive,Very Interesting,"I really like te Eddie Dickens trilogy. They are fun books to read because of how they are writen. The author knows how to keep someone interested in the book. During the book he will talk to you like he is telling you a story face to face. It is a fun way to read a book. What makes it even better are the characters. Eddie who is very young is like the adult to all the grown ups. He has to tell them what to do and get them out of trouble. With all of his different adventures he goes on, it makes it hard to put it down because you want to see what Eddie will do next."
positive,Good and Timely,I received my order rather quickly. The DVD was in good condition. I would buy again from this vendor!
positive,Good Read,"Still reading. Only 10% read. So far it's an excellent read. It began with more detail about Harry's pre-generations which, to me, was pretty uninteresting."
positive,"It is what it is, and there is nothing wrong with that","I'll keep this review simple (and delicious). Like another reviewer said, it's pretty much all recipes and very little of anything else. You get the occasional kitchen shortcut, product comparison and article but nowhere near what Taste of Home or other cooking magazines offer. Is that a bad thing? Well it depends on what you're looking for. I subscribed because I wanted simple recipes I could make during the weeknight and not spend a lot of money. That's exactly what S&D delivers. As for the recipes themselves most of them are hits with only a few so far being near misses. Out of the three Taste of Home magazines, (Taste of Home and Healthy Cooking being the other two) this one is my favorite and the only one I subscribe to. If you're looking for an upgrade of this type of magazine then I would recommend Cook's Country."
negative,Pretentious and Forgettable,"An all star cast is featured in this oddball comedy about an actor who finds a daschund and goes through nothing but trouble in Monte Carlo when he realizes it leads to a murder, and in turn he gets entangled with other people in this so-called conspiracy. The photography is nice and there are some pretty good moments, but why do the stars shout nearly every line?"
positive,Amusing Book in an Amusing Series,"I didn't realize this was part of a series of books similar to the ""Dummies"" series, complete with cartoons. It does offer some light moments for a patient who is dealing with chronic illness."
negative,Wouldn't buy again,"I was swayed by the reviews to buy the Jumperoo. It is a nice product, but my five month old son doesn't want to stay in it more than ten or fifteen minutes. The toys on it aren't engaging enough. He likes it, but it doesn't keep him busy so that Mommy can get other things done- as I'd hoped. Given the space it takes up and how little he uses it time wise, I wouldn't buy it again. I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't have almple room in their house to spare for toys that aren't used often."
negative,there has to be,"other words in his vocabulary than n*&&$%, and there have to be other ways to make a joke than comparing Black people to White people."
negative,I Hate It! I cant get it started!,I hate this product! I am very disapointed that the fish don't grow! The water is the right temperature and the water is clean. I just keep trying and failing. This should not be purchased during the Winter unless you keep your house at 80 degrees.
negative,"Not an Easy Read, Often Incoherent","This book lacks coherence and many parts were often unintelligible. Simmons has the bad habit of making up his own words and terminology - this would not be such a problem if he defined them and explained the words when using them. However, he often does not explain the terms until hundreds of pages later, if at all!!(scholic,moravecs, voynix, faxing humans?- i still dont know what these are after reading the novel).He seems to be trying to tell more than one story at a time, and therefore the novel lacks any semblance of a normal progression. I often found myslf mumbling, ""what the heck is going on?"" and would look again and again at the story summary on the dust jacket vainly seeking an explanation.I understand that Simmons is considered a top Sci-fi writer- but he would sell lot more copies if he made an effort not to write in such an obtuse style."
negative,Disappointed Reader w/ Biased Views,"I purchased this book to help me in my decision whether to breastfeed, how long to breastfeed and to attain some basic knowledge of the process. I felt about 1/2 of the book was dedicated to convincing the reader why biologically woman was put on this earth to breastfeed and if you don't-- how much you may damage your child, 1/4th of the book discussed societal issues involving breastfeeding and the rest of the book really got into the details of how to breastfeed and how to succeed if you run into any problems. Other reviews stated the book wasn't preachy, but I disagree. The authors try to support their opinions with scientific data, but where no data existed to support their point, fell back on examples such as women in 3rd world countries who lack food breastfeed with good results and they also pulled some examples from the animal kindom. I found it quite offensive and disappointing."
negative,Bad ordering,I place an order for the CU720 LG Shine but was shipped the screen cover for LG VX8500 Chocolate and was charged for shipping when it came to me in a 1st class envelop with one USPS .40+ cent stamp.
positive,Casio's Best,"Casio makes several very similar watches, all of which are very sturdy, none have all of the features of the W-71 though.50M Water Resistance. I've killed watches before because I forgot to take them off before swimming. 50M means you can leave it on while swimming or washing the dishes.Day Date and Month. Lots of watches just give day and date. Yeah I know I ought to be able to remember what month it is, but it's nice to have it right there.A slightly brighter backlight might be nice. I've owned the Indiglo version before, and it's too bright for my taste, it also lacks the Month display."

negative,Nike Running Watch,"It is hard to see the screen when in certain light and buttons are hard to push while running. On some occasions I thought I pushed the botton and didn't, missing my stop time or lap time. When the run log is full it gives no warning and instead of erasing the first log in watch it just will completely erases the run time you are currently trying to save. Also had the watch for less than a year and took fairly good care of it but the strape broke off within 8 months. Spend a little more money and get the better watch...."
positive,Timeless,I bought this LP over 40 years ago and it still has the same draw to me today. She is quite the lyricist.
negative,"If you have a problem with RCA products, I hope you can get a refund.","Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3. When you call RCA Customer service, you will end up talking to someone in India or the Philippines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems.We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says, they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together. We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix. We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund."
negative,Not what I expected,"Requires ""special size"" paper. that is very small. Npthing like what I expected, will give it to one of the grand kids to play with."
positive,This product has its place,"We now have this shoulder/collarbone system and the arm-sytem as seen on TV. The arm_system is good for less-than-huge items. This strap system is best used by strong folk on the really big stuff ( Pianos, Pool tables, etc..)I hired a big guy to help out - he and I are big and tall - nothing stopped us with this strap set.MikeVegas, NV"
negative,The leaking reviews are accurate,"Unfortunately, I've also found the carafe to be a big leaker through the blade attachment, when I make a smoothie in the morning, it's all I can do to pull it from the base to the sink without a trail of banana blueberry on the floor. Every use the blade gets hand tightened, and all that does is postpone the leaking a few minutes.I could see if this was a cheap introductory level blender, but shame on KitchenAid for knowing of this flaw and keeping it on the market at a premium price. I think we are starting to see KitchenAid quality buckling under competition, as it's not the first item to fail me as of late, but that's for another review."
positive,A real lifesaver,I have recently relocated to New York City and could not have made it without this book. I usually pride myself in keeping up with what's happening - but I must admit this book has made my life much much easier with less effort. I am going to Paris in the fall - please tell me they will have one for Paris ssssssoooooonnnnnnnnn? (I have given several away to friends and they love them too.)
negative,watch this one when you need sleep.,This movie was one of the most depressing and slow moving movies I have ever seen in my whole life. I had loved the awesome songs that go along with the movie. But the movie I believe wasn't truely worthy of them. It's a good movie if you are starving for a false sense of knowing about the aquatic world. You get to know cool false information about dolphins and life on Antarctia. I would watch this movie late at night if I hadn't slept in weeks.
positive,Don't miss this forgotten classic!,"Orphan Maria Merryweather leaves her home in London after her father's death. She, her governess, and her dog travel to live with Maria's uncle. As part of her new life she is introduced to her family crest, the lion and the unicorn. She soon discovers a family mystery. The more she learns about her family's past, the greater her desire becomes to right the wrongs her family committed. The answer to the family mystery lies in the family motto ""The brave soul and the pure spirit shall with a merry and loving heart inherit the kingdom together.""The Little White Horse is an amazing classic with lots of symbolism and deep themes including forgiveness, repentance, atonement, intergenerational relationships, heritage, identity, fear, courage, purity, love, vanity, pride, gratitude, and humility.You don't want to miss out on such a beautiful, meaningful book. It's one of those ""forgotten classics"" which need to be remembered."
positive,This is the best gay comedy I've seen since the Bird Cage. Everyone I have shown it too loves it too.,This is the best gay comedy I've seen since the Bird Cage. Everyone I have shown it too loves it too. Now they all bought a copy.
negative,Does not work. Period. Do not buy. Defective.,"As simply as I can put it, it does not work. Even using the supplied recipes, it does not have enough mechanical advantage to push the dough out. Terrible design and should be recalled. I know Pampered Chef has since discontinued this item and replaced it with a press with a screw drive.DO NOT BUY."

WITH OVER 20 PODRACERS TO CHOOSE FROM, THINGS GO FROM TOUGH TO'WIZARD' FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY JEDI-WANNA-BE!~THE PRIMA COMPANY HAS DONE IT AGAIN!"
negative,PETA Members Alert!,"This is a typical piece of Italian ""animal torture"" garbage! Please avoid purchasing this at all costs so that DVD companies will not reproduce this type of sadistic trash. This film demonstrates acts of animal cruelty that would make a Nazi grin with glee."
negative,couldnt get it to work,I purchased this item for my direc-tv hd dvr to access my home network to get on demand. I couldnt get it to work using the enclosed cd. I couldnt get it to work after hours and hours with the Belkin support people. I hired a computer expert to try to get it right and he had no luck. I returned the item and gave up on the whole idea.
negative,Quite 'intolerable'.,"I think the title of this fits it quite well. I find it amusing. I saw the previews for this on TV and it looked good, so I decided to rent it. I hated it from the beginning. It was really, really boring. I thought for sure that this was going to be a great romantic comedy, but I found nothing in this to be funny OR romantic. I noticed the chemistry between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, but they barely went anywhere with it. They had one 'romantic' scene and that's about it. I was left wondering what in the heck went wrong there. There could have been a lot more done with this movie, too bad they didn't take a different approach and have a great love affair between Clooney and Zeta-Jones. They are both beautiful people, but this movie doesn't do it for either of them. If you decide to watch this, proceed with caution. I would NOT buy this. Rent it, if anything."
positive,Good quality product.,In my case this kit came in very handy. I was having some trouble doing the rear brake on a Volvo and one of the tools did the work. Good kit to have around the shop.
positive,A Great Summay of the Entire Industry!!,"This book was the greatest. As an aspiring screenwriter and director, it helps to get a large grasp on the industry. This book helped me enormously. It tells everything you could possibly need to know from employment in Movies & TV to minimum wage to contractual issues to what to stay away from. Just an all around great book."
negative,Not worth the money,"There is nothing in this ""book"" that you can't get online for free or in a 500-word magazine article. I was hoping for more in-depth discussion of treatment options and the underlying risk factors for PPD. This book offers nothing more than a cursory overview of the topic. Don't waste your money."
positive,the raw power of blues rock,"This CD was different from the other two Scott Holt albums. I like it a lot, but it is definitely more raw than the others. Not that it is a bad thing, actually I kind of like it that way. I think I had to regress through these three albums to truly appreciate Messin' With the Kid. I would have enjoyed it regardless, but for me, the appreciation came from the rough edges of this album as compared with the other two. It is like looking at someone's childhood photos...no matter how beautiful they are presently, there is something about them now that is more polished or hidden, something that is only evident when you can see them through comparison with an earlier self."
negative,cant sleep? put this on.,"I just sold my copy on ebay, So i did actually own this hd dvd. Unlike so many fake reviews. First off, The sound and video is awesome.Real reference quality. But it really doesnt hold up to repeated viewings. Shes really kinda hot, Almost like a young carly simon.Great guitar player too.The songs themselves are pretty bland.Which is a shame.The background videos are nothing special. Your better off putting on the planet earth hd dvd with pat metheny in the background. Now thats cool............"
positive,An Ok film,"Although this is an Audrey Hepburn film the over-riding theme is lying, but the underlying current is lesbianism. I didn't much care for that and definitely do not want my children watching this film EVER! Pretty much was not comfortable the whole show. Not recommended."
positive,Not quite a history book,"This book isn't quite a history book, nor is it a book on design theory. While it has aspects of both, it's more like a series of case studies, in which almost 100 designers, magazines, posters, advertisements, icons, types... are analyzed and discussed and placed in a historical context.So if you're expecting a comprehensive book on design history, this is not for you. In no way does it feel complete for a design education. What it does is provide thoughtful pieces to consider, and a perspective on the usage of design, originality, trends, etc. The authors do have a point of view, but it doesn't ruin the book. To the contrary, it makes it even more interesting. Design isn't just art and technique It's grounded in economics, history, culture, and politics. Heller and Pomeroy contribute a useful set of essays to help the reader become more aware of these relations."
negative,it is not worth it .,I got it for christmas two years ago and i play ed with it for two days and now it is sitting in a storage room broken.
negative,Not worth the money,Very poor book. Lack of working examples and not much more information than is contained in the Beans specification. Mr. Englander pulled the wool over O'Reilly's eyes on this one.
negative,Don't Buy one,"The drawers do not fit in the tracks or they come off the tracks. A great idea but so poorly made that the frustration of using it is > handiness.I would not buy one again. My husband has fixed it once. His fix allowed a couple more drawers to work. However, it can not be adjusted any further.Don't buy one - its junk"
negative,VERY INFERIOR PRODUCT,"I bought the double pack, black and color, and the first few prints from the color were fine, but, after that, things went steadily downhill. This is an inferior product and not worth any money. Don't buy this product."
positive,Best Swaddling / Receiving Blanket!!,"I just love this blanket! I was given the sterling color as a gift for my baby's baptism. It has a beautiful white on white look and pretty stitching around the edge. It ended up being a lifesaver because my baby girl got very fussy before the service. I swaddled her nice and snug, and she settled down. Whew!I was able to hand her to our pastor in a cute quiet little bundle and she was the perfect angel. I've since bought more in other colors; pastel pink and pastel yellow, because it seemed like one was always in the wash and I didn't want to be without one! I think 3 is a good number to have! The Ultimate Swaddling Blanket is the gift I give now to my friends and I include the matching Burpies, which are awesome too!"
negative,"Awful, smack in the middle of a very bad time of Oasis.","Oasis Live at Wembley 2000 -Oasis live at wembley 2000 is a awful show, its was smack bang in the middle of a rather awful time for the band.They realeased an awful album named ""Standing on the shoulder of gaints"" an experimental album, that was'nt very rock n roll at all.Neither is this performance, Liam sounds awful, image wise the band looks terrible, and Noels revoulting joke and colourful and flaming abstract visuals plague the screen and big screen behind the stage.Combined with a very untidy setlist from the dog ear of an album named ""Standing on the shoulder of giants"" it does'nt show Oasis as they really are today Live and how they were.Get ""...THERE AND THEN"" to experience the real Oasis."
positive,Does what it is supposed....,This toothbrush does what it is supposed to do. Go figure...LOL. Great powered brush for the money. Just make sure you dry the brush before you place it on the charger. If you don't it will start building junk up on the bottom and on the charger.
positive,Great!,This is the second case I got for my son. The first was the Cars case for regular cars and it is such a great ways to organize cars and have them ready to go. After my son started getting Monster trucks I new I have to get him the Monster truck case. Its a great gift or just a nice way to store Monster trucks! My son loves it and now have a choice from two to play with!
negative,dont buy this one,i have always been yonex buyer but this time i thought i would try victor but am utterly disappointed with this shuttle quality. it doesn't even last us for a single game of doubles. i would not recommend this to any of my friends. yonex is the best.
negative,This game sucks,"This games graphics suck, and the multiplayer and single player suck. everything sucks about this game including that you can't do anything cool, which sucks. I also think that the game sucks because of the fact that it sucks and also my little brother is better at it than I am. Also, another thing that sucks, is that my little sister killed me in the multiplayer mode. I mean, really, she's only two! One more thing, the lightsaber just plain sucks. I don't know what all you people are talking about. Is it supposed to do anything cool or anything? It doesn't. It sucks."
positive,great TV,TV looks and works awesome. Don't get confused with audio visual experts. This TV is great for the money
negative,no more sequels,"this movie wasn't nearly as good as the first one, which wasn't scary either. it was more of a comedy than a horror movie. neither of them compare to I Know What You Did Last Summer."
positive,Blue Bulova,"I got my boyfriend an invicta pro diving watch for Christmas, but it was so bulky. Amazon let me return it in exchange for this watch and its great. My boyfriend loves it and wears it often. We are very happy :)"
positive,Great story,Wonderful plot. Love the interaction between Roake and Eve. Can not wait to read more of The Death series and how they both evolved.
negative,Not Pleased,"As an American Girl fan and collector I looked forward to watching this movie. The acting was great, the actors looked the part and it was lovely seeing all of the houses and such from that time period. What I didin't like is that they totally changed the order of more than 10 different scenes. They were all scrambled up and not anywhere near the order of the books. Also some quotes were also totally scrambled and were moved to different characters than who originally said them in the book. They also totally changed the ending with Jiggy Nye and it was really over done. All in all I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 stars. Some good things but overall the books were much better and the movie was scrambled up in every way."
negative,weak film,"Although Bates is quite good as Philby, and the scenes in which he parries questions from his low-key but penetrating inquisitor are well done, overall this film is disappointing. Only for those who must read or see everything about the Cambridge spy ring."
negative,Don't Bother,I bought this software and while the software is ok the customer service is horrible. I had a problem with the software that I bought and I received a snotty e-mail to my asking for help with the software.There are other software programs out there that can do the same thing with better technical and customer support. Don't bother with the message boards either the administrators are they same unhelpful people that give customer support for the program.
negative,worst water-based polish on the market,"I had an amazing experience at an organic spa in Philadelphia. I got home and went on Amazon to get my own water based nail polish. I knew about the ""don't use hot water on your hands for 8 hours"" rule with this polish type.This polish does not come out smooth. It is streaky. More streaky than something you get at Walgreens for .99I put 3 coats (3 coats?) on at 9pm last night. I woke up at 8am. I took a shower. The nail polish got all over the place and looked a wreck. I was late for work trying to get the darn stuff off. Worst water based polish ever! The thought is there...but the R&D; needs to be redone!"
negative,Marine Sniper Legend Carlos Hathcock Video Really 'Tanks',"It's no small wonder that this man had never before given (supposedly) an interview. When it comes to being an interesting interview subject, this guy is a seriously dull tool and the quality of the video itself is strictly bad home video. The few Vietnam stories explored are barely surface scratched and there's a bunch of other training and post war stuff that no one could possibly care about. Don't waste your money. There are no insights into the Vietnam war to be found here."
positive,Inexpensively AWESOME,"Prior to buying these glasses, I looked everywhere for cycling glasses (bicycling) that would sheild my eyes from bugs, but also not fog up on me. These did the trick. The key is the lenses sit far enough off your face that your own breath or humidity doesn't get trapped on the inside of the lense....its that simple. I've only had 'em for 1 month or 6-8 rides, but so far but they seem to be durable as well."
positive,Boom boom pow,"That title for this is the name of the song by Black eyed peas that I use to wake up my teenagers at noon. This subwoofer shakes the walls enough that they just fall out of bed. But the real reason I got it was for the surround sound during movies. It makes the inhome movies much scarier and you DO pay attention more to the action. Even the commercials use subwoofer sound to enhance their music and action, which is unheard by most people. The sound is very clean, no scratch, buzz, hiss, rumble. Glad I didn't spend more."
negative,The policeman's story,"Buying this book about a year ago I struggled with spending money on a person who made a living stealing. It was written well and I enjoyed the action. However, I Just finish reading Badge 149 the author is the policeman who arrested him. Wow, it was definately interesting to see the other side of his jewerly heist! All the action and this time money was well spent and some dedicated to fallen policemen !!!!!!!!"
negative,My Escape Plan,While listening to this was inevitable. I needed to come up with one to get away from its monsterous grasp. The noise was so intense I could barely move. Good thing I had enough strength to think up the plan and eventually break free.
negative,I've had better,I wanted a stove-top cappuccino maker that I could put in the dishwasher. I think the aluminum ones are better. I just don't care for the way this one handles.
negative,Ehhh iss ok,"I heard Hands Down, the first single off this new album, it was a good song, i really enjoyed it, but its not worth buying the cd if you think all the songs are this good/type, i bought this cd hearing hands down and liking its newer version with an electric guitar in it hoping to find a much different/better sound, i was wrong, dont buy this cd just because of Hands Down or you WILL be disappointed."
positive,Needed a skinny seat,I needed to fit 3 car seats across in my van. This seat is one of the skinniest available. The only problem is that it is so heavy! If you are leaving it in the car permanently than that won't be a problem though. But if you are switching it from one car to another or expecting it to be easily carried you should be warned. Otherwise the seat is just what I needed.
positive,Motherless Daughters,This is a very good book that I would recommend to a younger female. I could really feel the pain of these young women! I
negative,Don't Waste Your Money,"These are expensive and very difficult to assemble. If you execute the procedure like a rocket scientist, they will leak. If they don't leak, the milk won't come out of the nipple. I tried them once and my baby surely thought I was crazy. Anyway, use the regular playtex bottles."
negative,Don't get me started.,"Boring, long winded and about a 3 on the suspense scale (10 being the best). But he's still the King, only this time the King has written better books. Oh, how I long for another Needful Things!"
negative,Probably Not Necessary,"I purchased three McKenzie rolls and this one, the one for the bed, was probably overkill. I used it once and felt it was really uncomfortable. The darn thing is so large, it's too much trouble to send back."
negative,paper feeding problem.. solved..,"Update: 5/8/07I finally contacted HP about the paper feeding problem. I chat with the HP associate online, and it was a plesant chat. He was really nice. After some troubleshooting and the problem still hadn't been solved, he agreed to send a cleaning kit to me for free (as it was covered by the warrenty). The cleaning kit came and it worked. I've been using the printer for a couple of months after the cleaning, and it's working with no problems. So if you encounter the same problem, try contacting HP.Just like other users have commented, this printer doesn't automatically get the paper, so you have to stay ready by the printer to feed each page. It gets very annoying. The reason I gave it a 2 star is because of it's quality of the printouts. Also, the ink is fairly priced."
positive,Fun Read!,A really fun read. Story moves along quickly with great humor that is unexpected in a vampire novel. Recommended it to family members.
positive,WALK TWO MOONS WAS EXCELLENT,"This book was truly written well. It has a story within a story, which kept me interested. Sharon Creech does a wonderful job of creating Salamanca, and her Grandparents. They seem to just come alive. The content is great, and it has excellent conflicts, and resolutions. The young girl's search for her ""identity"" is truly heartwarming. A+++ Book."
negative,No Joy in the Aire,"The first two Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums were absolute classics. Sadly, Christmas in the Aire is just a feeble attempt to generate some more sales by cashing in on Mannheim's previous fame. Save your money and stay away from this album."
positive,This is a great financial calculator,"I've had one of these since 1992 and I love it. I just came across this site when I thought I had lost mine and I was freaking out wondering how I'd get by without it.I'm a little surprised that it hasn't dropped in price over the years and I'd like it if it had a rolodex-type function, but you can sort of get that by storing addresses and numbers as functions.The financial functions rock, as does the solve menu. The menu-driven format is also neat, as it saves on clutter on the keypad."
negative,Barbie Houses,"When will Mattel learn to use more durable materials when constructing their Barbie houses? The first Barbie houses were made out of cardboard (even the furniture)! In the late 60's Mattel began making Barbie houses out of cardboard covered in a smooth, almost stretchy-type of plastic (but the furniture was thin and brittle). Currently, Barbie houses are constructed out of a brittle-type of plastic and I am through wasting my money on them. Why doesn't Mattel wise up and use the same material for their houses that Barbie dolls are made of? Even better would be to use the type of plastic that Little Tikes uses for its toys. Perhaps it's a ploy and Mattel really doesn't want their Barbie houses to last!"
negative,Lest we forget...,"Yes, this movie is poo-poo. There's no denying that. But to all the people who are outraged that Leatherface dresses as a woman, I feel that they should be reminded of a few facts. The inspiration for Leatherface, Ed Gein, cut the skin off of dead women and made a whole suit that he wore on a regular basis. Just like Buffalo Bill (Silence of the Lambs) and Norman Bates (Psycho), were crossdressers, and also based on Gein.And the fact that in the original, Leatherface had his ""pretty lady"" mask with lipsick and other make-up on when he was cooking supper.I wonder if the picture on the DVD cover of Renée Zellweger was taken when she realized she still had a career after being in this turd of a movie."
positive,A cut above most of the genre,"As others have noted, ""Superbad"" follows in the footsteps of countless ""last party of the senior year"" movies, and relies on many of the standard situations. It rises above much of the genre, however, by throwing in a couple of over-the-top cops, and through well-tuned dialog among the three teenage buddies. If you don't mind a lot of bad language (and countless humorous drawings of penises) ""Superbad"" will keep you laughing fairly constantly."
negative,error,that card or code dosnt work say something like have a mistake or that code is unable for that aplication or somehing like that please i need a solution or i need my money back i really appreciated your help
positive,Piece of Cake,"My ceiling fan had the almost identical remote control that worked flawlessly for more than 7 years. When it finally died, I purchased the Westinghouse control to replace it. Installation was easy and took just about 20 minutes. It works great and I expect it will last a long time."
negative,Acorn: THINK OF THE HEARING IMPAIRED,"I really get upset to see so many good movies without closed caption; is it really too expensive to add subtitles to these movies. We view cc movies and would like to purchase them, even when they are expensive, but Acorn (the worst of the group) doesn't provide closed caption, altho they have started to put SDH (a subtitle) on newer movies. Couldn't they go back a few years and do the same with other fine movies? And really make an effort for cc with the new ones they are releasing?"
negative,The Black Art of Xbox mods,Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer. More details on opperating systems with the Xbox would have been helpfull. One still needs the internet and a good knowledge of where to go in order to find the rest of the puzzle.
negative,"Arrived quickly, but skips a lot while playing and now won't play at all","I was so very excited to see that there was this DVD for sale, as it was a used item, I was so delighted how reasonably priced it was. I have been renting it via Amazon and that was getting expensive. The DVD arrived quickly and was very well packaged...unfortunately, it doesn't play well. There are no obvious scratches on the DVD but it was constantly skipping and now I cannot even get it to play....I'm going to try it on my portable DVD player but it looks like I may have to purchase another one...oh well, at least it wasn't a significant amount of money...."
negative,very bad,"beware ...this product does not rflect what you are getting...you get a net and a bunch of string... you are suppose to put all this together...how, is a guess...you get about a thousand strings of different colors and you have to attached them to the net( size of an hankershift).so don't buy this product.cost me more to send back."
negative,Disappointed with watchband,Had to replace watch band. Too smallJust an inexpensive watch and I don't have high expectations. We'll see how long it lasts.
positive,Logitech Review,"The logitech cordless trackman is easy to use, It would be nice if it a way to control its sensitivity, otherwise it's great"
positive,A must play,"this game has a good length, and fun to play and figure out when your bored. good for kids 8 and up (im 9) i strongly recommend it to zelda fans, plus master quest is a good bonus to! although it is a little bit expensive, so get it at gamestop or some place like that. Link moves slow though. if you like this game, try this one. -)The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"

negative,Faulty product - problems with DHCP,"I purchased this router a while ago. After installing it and following the setup instructions, I found out the router wasn't obtaining an IP address from the cable network. I tried both using the router's MAC address, and making the router ""clone"" the PC's MAC address; none of them worked. Then I upgraded the router's firmware to its latest version; that didn't help either.At first, I thought the issue had to do with my cable company, but after reverting to my original configuration (PC directly connected to the cable modem), the DHCP problems were solved. Checking in Netgear's forums and in some other sites around the Internet, I've found many customers with similar issues.I decided to discontinue using the router, and to purchase a Linksys WRT54G, which has been working flawlessly.Think twice before purchasing this Netgear router... for the same money, you'll be able to find a better product."
positive,The very best of dan fogelberg,I very much enjoy this cd. I never knew that Dan Fogelberg had so many hits. Price was good and it came in the mail in just a couple days. Completely happy
positive,PPL,Had to get in on DVD just to watch the bonus stuff and see how the girls are together in real life. I love the series. It's soo suspensful and the end of each episode will leave you with wanting more. It will become you're new obsession.
negative,WTF,Saturate was pretty good. The rest of the album seams to be some desperate plea to become unpopular.
negative,"Brilliant sound, weak connectors, poor reliability","I have had two sets of these marvelous sounding speakers and both have failed. They feature outstanding lows, mids, and highs for about the best 2.1-channel PC sound I've heard.Unfortunately, they do not hold up. My first set developed a buzz after several weeks. I exchanged them for another set because I loved the sound so much. After about 3 years, my second set has failed. The left or right speaker would continually cut in and out, forcing me to fiddle with the wires and the connector to the subwoofer. Finally, today, I was happily listening to iTunes when all of a sudden the speakers began to buzz and pop until the sound cut out and the little green power light faded out, never to relight again. Very, very disappointing!"
positive,An extraordinary Series,An extraordinary Series.Perfect color. Remastered again.Wonderful scripts.Entertainment guaranteed for all the family.We waited for with anxiety the next delivery.A jewel for the collector
positive,10 batteries for 1 penny!,"i bought this from snowvoice. the batteries were shipped very quickly and (so far) work great.although the price for 10 batteries is only $0.01, there's another $5.00 for postage and handling but that's still a great deal. i bought 30 batteries and the seller even rebated me $1.50 on the total order. amazing!"
positive,perfect for jewelry storage,"As a rep for Stella & Dot, I needed something to store my jewelry where I could still see it all. This works perfect!! It holds rings, earrings, bracelets very well. There are different size pockets too. When I head to a trunk show I just hang it in my car on the garment hook and it travels well!Rebecca C.Stella & Dot, Independent Stylist[...]"
negative,Mixed up pages,"This book was going great until I got to page 60. The next page was missing and was clearly printed that way, not torn out. I flipped through the next few pages and realized that pages were put together all mixed up, so I've had to flip around to keep reading. It's very annoying and confusing. The publisher is Harper Collins. They should be ashamed of themselves. This book is a classic. Get the book, just not this printing."
positive,Get On Top,Very Informative and the girls in the salon loved this book. Every single woman need this in her library as a tool to be successful at finding a good man.
positive,The reference on the subject.,Look no further if you want a detailed illustrated reference on the CB750 ! Doubles as a great coffee table book too .
negative,"If you want Costner being funny, watch Tin Cup","Starts off possibly being worthwhile. But the over the top political improbability ruins some potentially reasonable social commentary I would have liked to give it at least a '3' were it not for this. Now a movie like ""Man of the Year"" is funny and makes a decent commentary at points...worth a '3'. Or ""Wag the Dog,"" which handles its improbability well while making its point."
positive,Time for a new edition of this!,"My copy of this great book is in a box somewhere, but I have a powerful hankerin' to read it again. New edition, please! This is the best distillation of Rucker's odd writing-- odd but wonderful. He's almost never without his tongue thrust firmly in his cheek in these stories, but the scientific and mathematical principles he's dealing with are thoroughly discussed and dissected. It's HARD to describe Rucker-- better to read some of his novels (Master of Space and Time, Wetware/Software/Freeware, The Sex Sphere, White Light, the Hollow Earth), all of which show a loose, easygoing style mixed with challenging theory-- kind of a cross between JD Salinger and Larry Niven. (But better than that sounds...) Anyway, Transreal! is a great collection of Rucker's short stories, many of which I remember well even 10 years later-- try out ""The 57th Franz Kafka"" and you'll see what I mean. If you find a reasonably-priced copy of this, leap!"
negative,Preschool,"I have worked out with many videos, brands and type of training for a number of years. I became an AKA last October and received my first prosthetic in March of this year. I found this video undemanding and way too preschool for me."
positive,"Great wine glass, when it ships in one piece","I've been using these glasses for 6 months and love them for casual wine drinking. They're great in that they go right into the dish washer with no problems and look beautiful coming out every time.I recently decided to expand the collection a little bit, and ordered eight more. The purchase went through Wine Enthusiast, and I wasn't expecting any issues since I've purchased directly from them in the past. However, and I thought you all might find this entertaining, a rather thin box showed up today and was not in great shape. I picked it up to the sound of raining glass shards inside. Upon opening the box, I found both tubes (each holding 4 glasses) almost completely smashed. I've gotten the occasional broken glass in a shipment before, but this is the first time I've received an entire box of broken glass. :-) Time to go talk to Wine Enthusiast about their shipping practices."
positive,Good live CD but...,"This was a very good live CD but I just didn't care for the songs Something to believe in because of certain lryics on the song as it was sung. Also I didn't really enjoy the song I don't like monday's. But to me rest of the CD rock because it had most of the hits all on one live CD. I think if your a true Bon Jovi fan like myself, then pick this live CD up, then also buy the CD called Cross Roads which has the main hits all on one greatest hits album. Then between the live CD and the greatest hits CD you have the whole set of Bon Jovi. Then you can sit back and relax plus enjoy song after song of their music."
negative,Tarantino's Weakest Effort by Far!!,"I just don't know what to say? I'm a HUGE QT fan and this movie was just plain bad! How could the same writer/director of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill be responsible for this mess? The dialouge was never ending and it was not unique, quirky, funny, or intriguing like it was in his previous works...it was just ANNOYING. Also I don't think it would have been possible for QT to write more unlikeable female characters in the second half of this film. I was rooting for them all to die! And sadly, they were SUPPOSSED to be the heroes. Also, what happened to Stuntman Mike at the end of the film? He just wussed out. Very weak all around.Although I will acknowledge that I enjoyed much of the first half of the film and the car chase scene. Hence 2 stars instead of 1."
positive,dranzer s,"Dranzer s is the best blade. It with the Driger weight disk, the Dranzer s blade base with the attack disk from dranzer is pretty much unstopable. This is the best of the best buy it!"
positive,Nice story,This is they type of cartonish movies my daughter likes to watch. It has a beautiful story to it. My daughter loves it.
positive,Good item if only...,"Enough to hold a SLR, 4 lens and flash plus all the nick nacks in the zippered sections. Straps are strong, but zippers don't hold to firm, had to tie it together when travelling and walking around. but great product still."
negative,interesting and disappointing,"I watched this DVD last week and the best thing about it was that i could remember watching some of these performances on tv in the early seventies when i lived in Holland and watched the German live music show Beatclub on saturday afternoon, beatclub later on became musikladen, but i think the majority of these clips were from the beatclub era. From memory there should be much better material available than what we get here. Some of the clips are ok, but on the majority the sound is dreadful and it only has historical an sentimental value. I was thinking of buying other musik laden titles but after this I think i'll give them a miss. If you want good sounding historical stuff buy Woodstock orthe Great Whistle test compilation. Highlights for me were Santana and Procol Harum with an outstanding performance by BJ wilson, their drummer."
negative,So bad it's hilarious!,"I actually had a great time watching this movie because it's so bad, I laughed out loud throughout. All the positive reviews must be from people who are impressed with movies that have great looking people in them but don't mind that the plot is the most ridiculous piece of drivel ever written. Here's the whole movie: J Lo catches crook Clooney, sleeps with him, wakes up and he's gone, repeat...repeat....repeat.... Seriously! That is the WHOLE MOVIE! Every time she wakes up she's like ""Oh darn it. He's gone again. Guess I'll have to start over"". Critics were paid to give this movie good reviews; there's just no other explanation. As far as all the customers who gave it good reviews, I can only envy them for the great prescription medications they must be taking."
negative,"Misguided, but useful","The sidebars and the historical context of existing brand names is fantastic. The conclusions he draws in the main text are confusing at best, contradictory at worst.I don't regret having it, and it's got more naming information than any other resource I've found. However, his advice is based on very subjective conclusions and needs to be taken with gigantic grains of salt."
positive,This is a Fabulous Toy!,"My 15 month old daughter loves this table. She doesn't walk yet and is still at the cruising stage. She likes this toy because she can pull up on it and play with it while standing up. The side with the faux Legos on it doesn't interest her much, but it doesn't matter. The side of the table with the train, phone, and other activities on it keeps her very busy. I would recommend this table to anyone who wants to keep their baby busy for a good 10 to 15 minutes at a time and for anyone who wants to encourage their child to pull up, cruise, or walk."
positive,"Thought provoking & original, but you'll have to concentrate","From the start, this is an engaging book that captures the reader with an easy writing style and structure. That Strieber is an accomplished author, there is no doubt. This is the first book I have read on the subject of encounters that attempts to plumb the depths of 'why' rather than 'what' and in that respect it is very thought provoking. Strieber has made a commendable effort to present the visitor experience in a new and challenging light, although later in the book, new ideas and philosophies do pop into existence at an alarming rate and can be difficult to follow. On the whole I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to reconcile how the Visitors might fit into New Age thinking, but be warned, you'll have to concentrate hard on the last few chapters."
negative,really boring,"This movie was based on a book by Edith Warton. I liked Enya's song in the one part of the movie, but the story I thought was very shallow because everyone was so obsessed with being proper and rich. Some of the food looked good, but I got sick of seeing all of the cups and saucers and plates and watching men clipping and smoking their cigars. Everybody was always feeling sorry for themselves, and they all had too much to be feeling sorry for themselves. It drove me crazy. I liked Winona Ryder in Little Women."
negative,works in a pinch,"Quick points (it's just a shaver)- cuts decently close, but nowhere near a shave- large spacing between the teeth, so multiple passes necessary- batteries don't like to stay seated, a couple of taps of the unit against the hand usually get it running again- it does look good, with a blue power light and rubberized grip- the length attachment is AWFUL! fills up with hair, has to always be emptied, which wouldn't a big deal if it wasn't so hard to remove! the intended pressure point to squeeze the head to remove the spacer isn't very effective.I wouldn't recommend this for a clean shave or a 5pm shadow. this is good for longer-bearded guys who want to shape the beard or pick off the straggler hairs."
negative,Cats never touched it,"After hearing about so many cats finding this water fountain irresistable, I bought one in February. My cats like running water from a faucet as much as the next cat, but neither one of them ever seemed to take a drink from this new fountain. I ran it for about 6 weeks, but the reservoir water level didn't go down and I never saw them drinking from it. I finally disconnected it for good and am getting rid of it. It's just a little too large and a little too noisy to keep around for another try."
positive,beautiful music that permeates your heart and soul.....,"This album is one of the latest and greatest in my Latin music collection. Leonel Garcis and Noel Schajris have a gorgeous, lyrical quality to their harmonies, and their fusion of r&b;, hip hop and Latin elements will have you hooked. Some of my favorite cuts on the album include ""Que Me Alcance La Vida"" (a stunning ballad!), ""No Voy"" (a more uptempo song with a beat reminscent of old school Michael Jackson), and ""Junto a Ti"" (a hip hop inspired beat with Puerto Rican rapper, Vico C).This album is a great introduction to this marvelous musical duo. They have a romanticism that is very rare in today's music scene, and are definitely worthy of MUCH more exposure in the United States. I hope this album brings them a Grammy (and not just a Latin one!!!). I look forward to hearing much more from these guys in the future."
positive,really fun,Its a fun way to let someone know all different types of stuff about you. Plus you can do it as an activity together =)
positive,Excellent!!! I could not put it down...,"I never was much at reading the Bible, much less revelations, but after reading these books, I understand it so much better. It really shook me up. I have become a Christian just recently."
positive,Skating rough!!,"U think 1 was good 2 is so much better!! You can create skaters,park create,and more of a challage.BUY IT!"
positive,The Penis Unvarnished,"We American guys think we know everything about penises. But the truth is we know about our own--not the penises of our friends or men of other races and cultures. This book shows how circumcision can negate sensation. While USA guys love to parade our penises on nude beached in Europe oh so proud of the so-called superior beauty of a circumcised penis WHEREAS our European friends with their so-called UGLY uncut penises are having the last laugh as they get more of a thrill from their ""tool"" then we do with ours. The book shows us that the old rant about size NOT mattering is the bunk every guy has always known. Size matters to heterosexual women not to gay men as much. Read this to learn that a penis needs maintenance like an old wooden tennis racquet and needs to ""breath"" like fine wine."
negative,not impressed,"After reading all the positive reviews I had high hopes for this product. It left my hair stringy, did not help create curl, and had a weird residue. Oh well, on to the next."
negative,not recieved,"I have not recieved this product and the people who I buy it, they have been absolutelydeaf to my request they are only for the money not for the costumer service..."
positive,Perfect for the occasion....,Perfect for the occasion .... Came in a perfect case and was delivered on time ..
positive,The BEST robe I've ever owned!,"Our house is drafty and chilly and every winter I tote around my down blanket. But not anymore! Received this robe for Christmas and I haven't left the house since. It covers to the floor keeping my feet warm (I'm 5'4"")and the sleeves can be folded back if too long and it is still comfortable and looks nice.A fantastic, quality product, highly recommended!"
positive,Good thing I persisted,"After reading the first dozen pages, I was rather disappointed. I kept telling myself, ""Oh, well, at least I bought it used,"" but even so I was tempted to bawl out the reviewer from ""Analog"", I think, who'd gushed about the book. And then it clicked. And after that I was almost wholly happy. The gags, the one-liners, the action scenes - they all work nicely, even if the mushroom men make strangely low-powered enemies (I mean, falling apart because of shotgun recoil? Hardly brilliant...).All in all, a nice fast read with a good premise and decent writing. Hopefully, if there are sequels, they would improve on this."
positive,It works and is a great value.,"I use it to connect my Sirus/XM receiver, a microphone and my iPod Classic to a set of Genius speakers. It sounds good. The equalizer feature is a plus as compared to other mixers in its class. It priced right."
positive,Familiar,The details and thoughts of E. B. Sledge is that of similarity of my experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq. Very well put together book it explains so civilians but a lil to much for those of us serving in the military but fascinating to see how the phrases of Marines change over generations but the meaning is still the same.
positive,Special Edition adds extra sub-plot,"I've always known this film in the original theatrical version, which is well over 2 hours long. The Special Edition adds another 24 minutes of footage and adds an extra environmental sub-plot. I'm not entirely convinced by the longer version, which ends up being a little preachy, but it does add some extra interest and alien interaction. However, the original theatrical version is also included on the same DVD, with the classic solid-water tentacle effect, and deep-sea mini-sub battles, plus the superb performances of Ed Harris and especially Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who really should have appeared in more films."
positive,Powerlessons which translate into lifetime relationships,"I began using Dr. Melanie's Parenting 101 book in 1984 when I had a new baby. I quickly realized that this was the most significantly positive step I could take in executing the most important job in the world; and I never looked back! I still use Dr. Melanie's principles with my son who is now 15 years old, and truly, I believe to be a well developed human being. I am eternally grateful to have been given the opportunity to apply this information from the ""beginning."" Blessed are the educators for they empower us all."
negative,shockingly boring,"I understand the desire to shock a reader to keep things interesting however, in this book Frey did not succeed. I first read this book as a senior in high school and was unimpressed. It's an easy read and is moderately interesting, enough to get through at least, but Frey's attempt at being brutal and honest comes off as unrealistic and cold. He as a main character, although fictional, is very hard to identify with let alone like. Overall I really didn't like this book because to be blunt, it sucked."
positive,Stargate SG - 1 - Season 9,I really enjoyed all of the action. The plots were very well put together. The Stars were great. If you like science fiction this great. My family and I loved it . I can't wait to get season 10
positive,I couldn't watch Planet of the Dead on Netflix so I bought it here,It was a pretty cool episode and honestly pretty important to the 3 episodes that come after it. Titty Sprinkes
negative,Charmed - the complete second season!,I have not receive my order yet! This is the first time it happened to me. I am a regular amazon customer. This is my third year!
negative,"Great short time steam cleaner, not for the long haul","I bought this steam cleaner one year ago and have used it roughly 4 times. Each time I used it, I found I had to turn the rotating brush switch from off to on a couple of times to get the brushes turning. I didn't take it to get serviced, because Hoover won't cover the service charge, just the parts and labor. It worked great until the day after my warranty expired, which is today. The brushes won't turn at all and it will cost you about 75.00 to get the turbine replaced. And as an added bonus, the clean water tank has started leaking. A common problem, according to the repair guy. Save your money and get the Bissell steamvac. The service guy said by far he has had the least repairs on it."
positive,Work Great,"I have had these on my car for about 6 months now and they are holding up great. They held up through a very rough winter and are still wiping beautifully. They installed very easily on my 2001 infinity I30. I also bought them for my girlfriends 2002 Lexus LS430 and had some problems since Lexus has some crazy not at all standard wiper hooks. I had looked up compatibility and they should have worked. I eventually got em on, and they are staying on, but I don't think they were actually compatible."
negative,holidays on ice,This was a horrible selection for our book club. I didn't finish it & neither did most of the club. Very bleak & twisted.
positive,Great Telescope for Beginners,"(...)Max Advertised Power was I think 250 but with the 9mm and 25mm lens you dont even get close which are the defaults that the telescope comes with. You have to buy the Barlow lens or the 4mm lens to see saturn.Over all for the (...)price its really great, but buying the lenses will cost an additional (dollar amount), so total comes to about (dollar amount), for that price this is the best in its class."
positive,An electric jolt to game music from the master of game music,"At first i was leery about this album. Hard rock remakes of game music? Sounded like another Minibosses album...but then i saw the track list and beheld that one of my fave songs was on it. The eternal classic 'Dancing Mad', the boss theme for my all time favorite villain Kefka. Right then and there i knew i had to have the album, if just for that song alone. Luckily i found a used copy for cheap..and after listening to it..i realized just how wrong i was to judge this album without looking into it. With one glaring exception i.e. 'Battle Scene II', the entire CD is perfect. From the nostalgia bringing 'Battle Scene I', to the made-me-cry-in-bliss redo of 'Dancing Mad', and even the techno-esque 'J-E-N-O-V-A', everything was so..so...well, i can't really put it into words. So be a good Uetmatsu fan and get this album...NOW! I mean it! Click the buy button! you won't be wasting cash!"
positive,"I want ""More"" of Matt. West","The first time I heard the song 'More' on the radio I was instantly hooked and wanted to get the CD. I then found out another really good (and funny) song 'End, The' was by him and went out and got the CD immediately. Unlike most CD's where there are a few songs that just don't hit the point all of Matt. West's songs do! His lyrics are incredibly positive and the beat will never let you down. I really like how they made the CD look. And the little 'bonus' you get when you buy it.(You'll have buy it, to see what I mean.) Matthew West really blasted into Christian music. And I certainly know this won't be ""The End"" of his sucess."
positive,Great overall,This is a great camera and buy. the quality is exceptional and with a one hundred dollar external mic it has superior performance. It has dv in and out and av in out and still picture is very nice. i do not owne this product but use it almost every day in my video production class
negative,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"Well, I see from the reviews posted recently that some of WC employees are doing their duty by writing in. You can take my advice or leave it, it's up to you, but I'm telling you anything you buy from Wade Cook is a total waste of your money. Every book, seminar, or course he sells has one motive in mind, to get you to buy more and more Cook products. There are lots of excellent books available on investing and trading from people who actually made their fortunes trading, not by selling seminars and books like Mr. Cook. I notice one of the reviews said "" Mr. Cook realizes most people read on a 9th grade level, so he keeps is simple."" I've got some serious news for you my friend, if you can do no better than a 9th grade reading level, and you think you're going to learn to trade the markets, you are sadly mistaken. I have a suggestion for you, take your money and go to Vegas. You'll have a much better time than if you hand it over to professional traders."
negative,Big let down!,"I had high expectations of this book because Sylvia Plath came highly recommended by a reliable source, but I was counting the pages until I was done, painfully waiting for the book to get interesting and it never happened. It is easily in the top 3 worse books I've ever read category."
positive,An Addictive Story with Great Characters,"The Truth About Forever is my second Sarah Dessen Book. I have to say, I enjoy her writing. The story focuses on Macy after her dad's death. Macy is written to a tee. She experiences all kinds of emotions and they all seem real. There were definitely some times that I wanted to shake some sense into her, though. I understood why she was with Jason, but I thought it was strange how she never questioned the relationship. It's almost as if she's blind. Kristy, who is introduced a few chapters in, was the answer to my prayers. She tells Macy like it is and helps her see the light.This book sucked me in from beginning to end. The character development is great, and so is the story. If you haven't read any Sarah Dessen yet, I'd suggest you try this one on for size."
negative,Big Fat Let Down,"I bought this Coby dvd player because it was listed as being NTSC/PAL compatible. I loved this because I buy a lot of dvds from the U.K., dvds from some of my favourite shows like The Catherine Tate Show, Footballers' Wives, Keeping Up Appearances, etc. This alleged compatibility was totally deceptive. It should have been clarified that it would be compatible with tvs that are NTSC or PAL. It is NOT compatible with dvds that are Region 2 (PAL) coded. The only way this dvd will work with a foreign dvd is if it is listed as Region O. To say I was let down or miffed by this experience, would be a bit of an understatement. I will NEVER waste my money on a Coby product ever again! I would sooner set my money aflame.If you are wanting a dvd player to play Region 2 dvds, like those from the U.K., don't waste your money on this product. Trust me, you would be wasting your money."
positive,Too Stiff but nice,The belt is of nice qualify but a bit too stiff for my liking. I'm sure it will soften with time though.
positive,Lasher was as enthralling as the Witching Hour.,"I read The Witching Hour and was completely unable to put it down and when I went out and bought the sequel, Lasher, it was just as enthralling. This book is the best Anne Rice novel I have yet to read. It pulled me in and I am still wanting more even though I have finished the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little of the unusual and erotic."
positive,AWESOME!,"I've been fan of the series since '99, watch it on cinema 5th times, then i watch the animatrix online, play the game, watch the other two, and was looking foward to buy the Matrix Complete Collection on DVD, i didn't find it anywhere, so the time passed the technology changes, and i got this on my hands, it was a closedeyes order, i couldn't lose. Then after a long time, the package arrived, the Cover of the BOX, the BOX, the Disks, all the stuff, worth every dollar and time of shipping, i'm watching it right now with a cousin, he haven't seeing any, so now, watching it in HD for the 1st time, just imagine, he should write the review, anyway the content of the disks, the commentaries, To every fan of the series is a non-regret buy, so, if u think u're a huge fan, u should get it, and u'll get a lot of time of Matrix fun_"
negative,Mediocre...At Best,"There is nothing about the Williamsburg bridge in this novel. More importantly, there is very little learned about Chassidism. Essentially, it is a collection of stories the author tells that, at best, is tangental to his religion. Go elsewhere if you are looking for a book on Chassidism."
positive,The Joy of Uncircumcising is a true gift.,This book is well written and gives the truth behind circumcision's destructive qualities. The book is very helpful for men who feel they have had something wrongfully taken from them through circumcision. I strongly recommend it to anyone who cares about his body.
positive,Handyman's secret weapon.,"I have used this knife constantly since its purchase, and must say it is everything I had hoped for. Being very well balanced allows it to be thrown underhanded, similar to a shuriken. The double sides allows one edge to be sharp enough to shave with while the other can be a slightly more blunt utility edge. The sheath works great allowing easy removal of the blade, but tight enough that it has never slipped free while hung vertical on the back of my belt (which is where I typically carry it). Others complain about the maintenance, but I have never had a problem with rust even though I only sharpen it once a week and it is constantly used in moist conditions. I suppose if you hardly ever sharpen or use the blade it would rust due to the high quality cutting edge.I strongly recommend this over the other boot knives sold online, or locally."
negative,This is unethical,This is probably the worst bigfoot film i have ever seen. four dudes in a hotel room talking about bigfoot does not qualify as research. don't buy it. its borderline unethical. '
negative,"james cameron, what happened?","alright, let's get the basics outta the way. While the special effects and disaster scenes deserved all the credit it got, this movie sucks. it's supposed to be a great love story, yet it's about a future wife committing adultry with a bum. plus it had a bad script. hell, i believed Total Recall had better acting and a better script than this. if you want a good and/or historically correct movie, consider watching these: Saving Private Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption, The Untouchables, hell, watch Superman. that's probably more likely to happen than in this crap that evidentally deserves 11 academy awards. If you want a real movie worthy of that much oscars, watch one of the best movies ever: Ben-Hur"
negative,Good idea that turned out bad,"Couple of things you need to know before you consider buying one of these:1. Picture quality is poor (pixely), even in true color and no matter what, screens have blueish shadow that you can't get rid of.2. Control Utility that actually sends the signal to the player from your machine (in wired or wireless setup) will eat up 70% or more of your processing power, bringing machine down to a crawl. I tested this with 4 different computers and all exhibited the same problem.3. Not all Wireless NICs will work with the player; you're better off investing in Link WNIC if you want some kind of wireless functionality.Overall, great idea that went wrong. Link support is nonexistent and I couldn't deal with slowness issue. Sent the player (and Wireless USB adapter that I bought for this) back the very same day.Stay AWAY."
negative,Falls Flat,"I barely made it through this movie. The story contained an endless string of awkward moments with nothing uplifting in between. Well, it tried to be uplifting in places, but fell flat. There was no drama and no successful comedy. The actors gave monotone performances and none of the characters were particularly likeable, especially Jennifer Garner's character. In my humble opinion, watching this movie was, frankly, a waste of time."
negative,Doesn't last,"If you don't mind replacing this machine frequently, then you will probably like the popcorn it produces. Our first lasted about a year, before an internal part popped off and couldn't be repaired. In good faith, we bought another, but it lasted less than 6 months, before we the heating element began to fail, producing lots of under-popped corn. Would be great if they could just make them last longer! We're going to get a Whirley-Pop to use on a new gas stove!"
negative,The Magic ends here....,"I really enjoyed the first two books. This one- HUGE disappointment. Maybe it was just me?.. I didn't enjoy that this author kind of rewrote the rules for this book. The writing style isn't true to the first two, making it a little confusing. Little things like the change in everyone's dialect killed the credibilty I was trying to give Herndon. Maybe the only thing that kept me motivated was the urge to finish the series and it was so suspenseful ~ more action and cheesy combat cries than needed for a plot like this. I have to admit in few places the battle action was well worded and some conversations made me laugh.. But still, overall, two stars."
negative,OUCH!,"These are too long to fit well resting in the outer ear and too thick to fit in the canal. They're much less comfortable than the earbuds that came with my Sansa MP3 player, and the sound quality isn't as good, either. I'll be replacing mine before they wear out--a first for me!"
negative,Firefly TV soundtrack,"I enjoyed this style music quite alot. I am a fan of the show, and hearing it there led me to purchase the CD. There is a small draw back in that the music pieces are very short. I would have liked 2 CDs with longer cuts....but Great Stuff!"
negative,"Outdated, don't bother with it","The wrk54g is outdated and poorly functional with newer devices. Mine was requiring rebooting often and had an interference problem when used with Samsung Galaxy tab. Cisco does not support this device as you cannot get updated firmware. Don't waste you time with it. Try a Belkin, I've had good luck with my n600. Or perhaps a Dlink.Terry"
positive,"Read, mull, spew?",Why does the story of one woman's journey inspire so much angst? Maybe for the same reason most of us haven't yet learned to respect an opinion (and the opinion giver) that differs from our own. Of course she's imperfect for Pete's sake...she's human! And she wrote a book many people have enjoyed reading. What is so terrible about that?
positive,Cute but not durable,"Cute little doll that my daughter likes but ripped easily.. she is a teenager and doesn't exactly ""play"" with her dolls...they just hang out on her bed and dresser."
negative,Did not work for me,"I bought this to put PC signal on my monitor and my TV. The signal was weak and made both desktop monitor & LCD tv jump, blur, etc... I ended up buying an electronic splitter which works great. See my other reviews"
negative,"Natacha, no offense but I dont listen to you for hip hop!","Natacha, I love your voice and I am deeply disappointed every time your music veers into banal, incessant western pop culture! I give you two stars for track 8 & 10. The rest is not worth anything except to make me cringe because you have one of the greatest voices we will ever have the priviledge to hear! Imagine Leontyne Price singing Brittney Spears! I hate to sound pompous but give me a break ok? I hear this kind of stuff coming out of every club and car in the USA, can't I be a fan of your Arabic music and voice? What would you think if Beyonce did an album in Arabic?"
negative,Aggravates asthma?,"My housekeeper, who has worked for me for 3 years, says Mrs. meyer's effects her asthma. I have used many other 'eco-freindly' products in the past which has not caused a problem. I recommend not using this product. I thought it was a superior ALL NATURAL product since it was sold in WF. After purchasing another of Mrs. Meyer's products, my wife complained about a metallic taste left in her mouth. I did some research and found they use artificial fragrance. Is this what is causing the issues in my home? I would not purchase again."
positive,So far So good.,"Nice hair dryer. Does the job efficiently. Hope it lasts a year. I seem to replace hair dryers every year. Funny thing is I only blow dry 2x a week. Babyliss has a good reputation for quality, particularly on the professional level. Spent the extra money hoping for better quality. So far, So good."
positive,US map jigsaw,We live in Ireland and on our last holiday to the US I bought this for my wife to improve her US geography. It is very well built and the pieces interlock well together - however I think after a few months use the wooden base is tending to bow a little. However an excellent educational aid for all ages.
negative,DISGUSTED! ! !,"Thought this would be a good comedy. Unfortunately, it was NOT as seen on television...a LOT of suggestiveness & nudity! How unfortunate for these actors to sink THAT low, just for a few dollars! Didn't even watch the whole movie; after about 20 minutes my husband & I had had enough! Don't waste your money on this one!"
positive,Pretty darn good basic answering machine/telephone,"The machine seems reliable and efficient, with good sound quality and attractive, pleasant design. There are second-level annoyances, however: The ringer choices are all irritating sounds, the message light is too big, too red, and too much like an emergency vehicle toplight. I like the language choices on the day/time readout and the ease of programming. It replaces an earlier model of the same brand I had for over ten years which was equally reliable. Bravo AT&T."
negative,slips right off,"I did not really care for this product. The collar slipped right off my dog. The Customer service rep was really accomodating and was willing to send me a smaller one, but I really doubt that would even do the trick. I have a 7 pound dog and a 16 pound dog and this collar was even too loose for the 16 pound dog. He just took it right off. The thing wouldn't stay on at all. As soon as I put it on, my dog would shake his head a little and the thing would fall right off. I would not buy another one."
positive,Beautiful,"This CD takes Hillsongs Australia's best music and turns it into instrumental only sets that are perfect for relaxing, de-stressing, and doing devotions to. If you love Hillsong Australia or Darlene Zschech's music, this is a must-have in your collection. I would also recommend this album to worshippers who want something other than hymns that's not incredibly upbeat and want to put ""a new song"" in their heart!"
negative,not recommended,"Grass seed was spread as directed. Grass finally grew after 12 days and not the 5 days as promoted and came in sparsley. We had hopes, based on the promotional information, that we might get some grass seed that would finally grow well. This was not the case. We would not recommend this product as it did not perform as advertised."
positive,"Hello ,Michael Here","Hello , Covers all the basics quite nicely , easy to read and understand. I would strongly suggest you read this book and at least one other on your specific interest before you spend a dime on coins."
negative,waste of time...,Thought for SURE I'd like this one-----NOT!!!!! Kinda seemed like a Saw rip-off in a way. Cept SAW movies are 110% Better!!!!! Dont waste ur time like I unfortunately did..
positive,"Old, but still great!","It's hard to believe that it took Survivor so long to rerelease their entire catalogue on CD, but they finally did it, and it's a good thing. I've heard all of their other albums, but couldn't find this one anywhere until now. While it may lack some of the depth of their later albums, it contains some of their catchiest, rocking melodies ever. As some of the other reviews pointed out, this one is more guitar-based than the Jim Jamison stuff is, and at times, it almost has an ""Iron Maiden-lite"" feel to it. Perhaps some people will be turned off by the lack of ballads which infused albums like Vital Signs and When Seconds Count, but if you're just looking for catchy, feel-good rock, definitely give this a try."
negative,Probably could be better,"Developer exam is not really covered, there are also several typos and mistakes (probably present in other hastily made Java certification books). Wide almost unused page pargin is really annoying, so many trees would be cut for the author and publishers to make money. Programmer exam topics probably could be covered somewhat better. But the book has the only coverage available today on Architect exam, even if there are probably better generic books available on the topics."
negative,Did not work with Windows 7,"My item arrived today. When I plugged it into the USB port of my computer, it showed up as an unknown device. After several attempts to get it to work, including going to the Sabrent website and downloading their Windows 7 driver, it still did not work. I had ordered a SYBA USB to Parallel Cable at the same time as a back up. Using the same USB port, Windows 7 recognized it immediately. I plugged the original printer cable into this cable, and within two minutes I was printing. For the price, it was well worth it for me to buy both types of devices. If Sabrent refunds my money, great. In the mean time my printer is working."
negative,Old Cinderella,"This was the old cinderella, we grew up watching on VHS. It's an older version 2D, but kids love watching it as it is slow and not too much confusing graphics."
negative,Digital Audio does not work,"I bought these cables right before the Xbox 360 came out. Soon afterwards, I hooked it up and couldn't get the digital audio to work. The receiver noticed it was getting a signal, but apparently the cable was corrupting it. Don't waste the money on these. Spend the money on first party accessories."
negative,Not a winner at all. The least of all the Adagio series.,"Puts you to sleep, I don't mean relaxation, but sleep."
positive,Passionate and Bizarre,"I read this book mainly because it was talked about a lot in Eclipse. I was shocked by how dark and Gothic it was. I can't imagine what people must have thought when it was published. If I could pick two words to describe Wuthering Heights it would be ""passionate"" and ""bizarre."" I've never read anything like it. I knew as I was reading it that I wasn't supposed to like Cathy. She has a passionate temper that was very unlikeable and yet I couldn't hate her. In fact, I related to her in a lot of strange ways. I kind of agree with Edward Cullen's assessment of the book that it's not a love story but a hate story. The ending was what made me like this book. A lot of the characters are run madly by their passions and I thought for sure the ending would be nothing but a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. If Eclipse has made you curious as to what happens in this book, give it a try. You might actually like it."
negative,Don't waste your money.,"This would be a fantastic item - if only it would work! I followed the instructions exactly and repeatedly for set up. It works great for about 20 minutes, then it loses the remote signal from the probes even when the receiver is located 15 feet away from my smoker. The signal won't come back until I go through set up, re-entering every setting only to lose the signal again in about 20 minutes. I made certain that I haven't exceeded operating temperatures or violted any other parameters for use. This product is a dog!"
negative,Bad Collection,"While Gundam Wing is one of my favorite anime's, this collection is horrible. I had to order it a total of 3 times due to scratches on many of the discs. Because of these scratches, many of the episodes would freeze and skip. Overall, while Gundam Wing is a great classic anime, this collection was very poorly made and I suggest that anyone looking to own the series should wait until a different set becomes available."
negative,eh,"The product sits precariously on your hips since you can't adjust at the hips...as noted by myself and several people that used it. The length of chain is short and does not accomodate large weights easily despite the picture shows the man dipping with two large weights. But it does it's job, I guess."
negative,Good shaver,I have not used it much. But from whatever little I have used it seems to server its purpose at a low price
positive,mailboss is a good design,"This box is sturdy and easy to install. However, after putting it on the old post, I realized it was too high (as the entire unit is 5 inches bigger than the old box) so I had to saw off the post and re-install. The only suggestion is to enlarge the out-going mail slot, as the NetFlix just barely fits, with one side folded up. There have been questions about it from neighbors, with their locking boxes appearing so flimsy. Very happy with this mailbox."
positive,If Rod Stewart had read William Burroughs,"The late Eighties was not a particular great time for Rock Music, with a lot of Glam Metal seeping in from the U.S, with a overproduced sound & deposable lyrics.The Dogs were the exception to the rule, with a plug in & play attitude to studio production, & really articulate lyrics.If I have to describe their sound, musically The Faces, words Bob Dylan.They had a run of five strong albums, this probably just about being the best, with Tyla hitting a creative peak at just the right timeI do think it's about time they re-released all their back catalogue, with extra tracks.Other Dogs Da'mour albums worth listening to:(Un) Authorised Bootleg (1988) ****In The Dynamite Jet Saloon (1988) ****A Graveyard of Empty Bottles (1989) *****King Of The Thieves, released as ""Errol Flynn"" in the UK (1989) *****Straight (1990) ****More Unchartered Heights of Disgrace (1993) ***Happy Ever After (2001) ****"
negative,Not very helpful for a beginner,"It is what it says it is, Norwegian to English. As a beginner there is no reverse English to Norwegian translation which is very frustrating."
negative,No Creativity!!!,"I was so disappointed by this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! As all the other reviews have noted, it is just old material recycled. But the transition into this old material was also horrible. My two year old daughter even recognized that these were just the old movies rolled into one."
negative,VB or C?,VB or C which is it? I don't mind books the have syntax for both VB.net and C#. I also don't mind books that have JUST C#(since I don't know C# why would I mind this?). I Like books that have JUST VB.NET since thats what I like. But this book doesn't do any of these! It provides C# only on many occasions! And as a VB.NET only programmer its awfully hard to build on C# examples. It's almost as if the authors didn't know how to code everything in VB.NET and just skipped it sometimes.
negative,Why?,"Willem Dafoe was great in this film, but that's as far as this good review goes. Maybe, I just didn't ""get"" what they were trying to do with this film. The story seemed extremely underdeveloped and was very rushed toward the end. Like the entire film crew suddenly realized that they had drug their feet during filming and had 10 minutes to tie it all up. Nosferatu was brilliant, and this almost downplays it's brilliance."
positive,Appears to be a good repllacement...,"I was a lttle skeptical after reading some of the other reviews saying that this filter media pad was received without a frame or wrong size. However, I received my order a few days ago and although I haven't used it yet, visual inspection shows the metal frame around the pad and it appears to be the same size when placed on top of the existing humidifier pad. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I haven't actually used it yet (Murphy's Law). If no problems when I actually install this new replacement pad, I will order more to have on hand."
negative,So disappointing,"We purchased this monitor thinking it would be a great way to help our 2 year old transition into his big boy room, but were quickly aware this might have not been the best choice. There is a constant clicking sound that comes through the monitor receiver, the lights are not indicitive of the baby's cries, it turns on at random times and last night static surges woke our 2 year old up at 5 a.m. What a disappointment since our son likes the light show so much...but there is just too many negatives to keep using this monitor."
positive,love it!,"Get this! I have a 37"" LCD that I installed in our bedroom. I couldn't believe the satellite TV installer wanted $100.00 and a popular installation service wanted more than that to drill some holes and drive some screws!This was a piece of cake to install - if you have some basic ""handy-man"" skills. A stud finder and a level is essential. You will need 2 people to do it-it could be a little tricky holding it on the wall while mounting it and hanging the TV.Once installed, you can change the height of the TV some, and the tilt angle makes viewing the TV from our bed a pleasure.The price was right on Amazon - a similar item sold in a popular home-improvement store was near $100.00...and I had it delivered in a couple of days. Thanks Amazon!!"
positive,Just Nick Carter? - Just Fantastic!!!,"Forget Backstreet boys, forget Aaron Carter's brother - this is neither of these. It's just Nick Carter and it's brilliant! Now or Never is a fabulous showcase of Nick's wonderful talents. It's not Backstreet Boys - with this album Nick has shown that he can sing something other than full blown pop songs and has revealed a gorgeous guitar rock style that fits his voice perfectly. Who knows if Nick is going to record with the Backstreet Boys ever again but if there is more like this on the way from his solo exploits then frankly I don't care!!"
negative,Sleeper!! Don't bother buying...it's better rented...if at all,"I love my horror movies. Straight to the point stalker/slasher/murderer/hauntings, etc., but this documentory type horror movie was totally boring. I think the plot of the story was stupid and then unfolding the movie was even worse. Don't waste your time buying this one."
positive,Best CARS DVD ever!,My grandson loves this movie so therefore I am buying him another DVD for when the one he has wears out from him watching it so often.
negative,Very Cheap!!!,"Yes, this is a cheap phone in many ways! I have had it since Aug. 2003. This has been our primary phone. The features are easy to use and I like the different ring tones for certain callers. It worked great For several months. Since then it will not hold a charge. If you are on the phone for more than 30 min. or if it is left off of the cradle for more than two hours it will go dead. I have had static lately and called the phone company they said it was the phone. From the other reviews I may have gotten a lemon, all I know is that I am anything but happy with it's performance."
positive,Good Food!,As always Learning Resources brings pretend play to life...the only reason I gave this set a 4 star rating? I wish there were 2 of everything...the single shrimp...or single cake...makes it hard to serve up a crowd. (But to be fair i knew this when ordering)...the information that came with the play food is really interesting too...tons of fun facts regarding where each item is served up in the real world and even some recipes to make at home...we plan to use this info to take my daughters imagination to the next level...I would def recommend!
negative,Hella H4 100/80,"Bought 2 Hella H4 100/80 lightbulb, lasted 4 weeks before low beam stopped working, thought Hella was a good brand, are very disappointed !!!"
negative,Lucas sucks,"George Lucas is an A**HOLE he knows what we want and refuses to give us a blu-ray quality of the actual original production with surround sound. Yet several times he's acted like he was giving us what we wanted then you get it and you find it has crappy video and audio, or like this version where he calls it original when it's the remake."
positive,Well worth the investment,"The ITrip makes listening to the Ipod in your car very easy. YOu simply plug the Itrip into the top of the Ipod and tune your radio to a blank station(I use 87.9) and that's it!!!!No Wires, No charger, Just the Ipod. The Itrip is small, so it will not weigh down the Ipod and again, with no wires, you can just rest the Ipod on the dash or on the passenger seat or in your lap and you are ready to go!!Sometimes, there is a little static. The battery life of the Ipod is pretty significantly shortened(my Ipod is supposed to last 5 hours on one full charge; with the Itrip it is more like 3 1/2), but these minor setbacks don't matter to me; because I always have 7500 songs in my car with no fuss!!!For $20.00, you simply cannot go wrong!!ENJOY"
negative,"Doesn't work, no support","I bought this and installed it, along with the drivers (which I had to download from the AVerMedia site; no CD was supplied). No go. I called AVermedia and was dumped into voicemail, and never got a call back. I then called the vendor, Newegg, and they refused to help me outside of RMA'ing the product.So, in short, it doesn't work, and no one I've spoken to or tried to speak to seems to both not know what's wrong, or willing to investigate. My system is Vista ""Ultimate,"" on an Nvidia motherboard; I suspect this card isn't supported on either Vista or a non-Intel board. It would have been nice if the documentation on the site noted either.I have an old AVerMedia card, maybe 6 years back, and I was happy with it. But I'm disappointed in their support, or lack there-of, and with the vendor from whom I purchased it. I'll RMA the board. In a nutshell, this is probably a good card, but you have to have the right combination of OS and motherboard for it to be recognized and work."
positive,I liked it,"I think this is a good poetry book and anyone who likes Jewel's music will probably enjoy this. O.K. so she's not a professional poet, but she's honest and she's talented. Some of the poems are a little corny, but others are really good. I think this book shows more of Jewel than any interview could. So if you want to know more about her, read it."
negative,Did not arrive in time & not needed for Italy,"I bought this item because I was going to Ialy. The product did not arrive on time and therefore I returned it when I returned from my trip.I ended purchasing a converter in Paris for 3.70 euros. This converter worked perfectly in both France **and** Italy. My advice - if you are pushed for time, just buy whatever you need when you arrive in Europe. It's cheaper; you know it will work; *and* there is no hassle."
